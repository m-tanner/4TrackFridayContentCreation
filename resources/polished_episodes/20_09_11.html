                Sax | Walk Along to Hear Thoughts of Your Own | Laura Misch
            </h2>
<p>
                Laura Misch is an experimentalist based in South London that I accidentally discovered this morning.
                A sax-forward follow-up to the trumpet and piano tracks that so many of you recently loved,
                this track is a bit more relaxed and rhythmically experimental than the others, but comes across with
                a creativity that I hope you enjoy!
            </p>

                Shiny hooks | Sick Muse | Metric
            </h2>
<p>
<i>Fantasies</i>, the 2009 follow-up to Metric's <i>Live It Out</i>, took the group decidedly
                into the land of poetic lyrics and pop hooks from what was pretty edgy New Wave.
                In fact, my favorite recurring element to the album is
                Emily Haines' lyricism. Especially on this track, her words have a way of cutting through
                the rest of the glossy, indulgent instrumentation and I can't get enough of it. I always come back to this album
                every year or so, and it's a delight every time.
            </p>

                R &amp; B | Coffee Cups | IJALE (feat. Zephyrrgreene)
            </h2>
<p>
                IJALE is a Melbourne-based producer, vocalist, and performer. Blending his Australian upbringing with
                his Nigerian heritage, he makes multifaceted music that combines elements of jazz, soul, RnB, and hip hop.
                This track comes from his stellar debut album, <i>Wildly Disparate Sounds</i>, which released this summer.
                It specifically contrasts a slow beat with relaxed-yet-snappy bars.
                He's new on the scene and I know I'm looking forward to following his career.

                Nap time | It Always Takes | Inspired Flight
            </h2>
<p>
                In my recent time between jobs, I made an effort to take as many naps as I could and this track has
                always been a staple for that effort. Elliot showed this track to me long ago and
                I'll never forget it. Comprised of Gabe Lehner and Eric Poline, the duo have developed a rather hypnotizing
                sound that's rooted in downtempo and hip-hop. Drift away with it.
