                Hi friends,
            </p>
<p>
                Big thanks to Rachel and DJ for hosting last week. I know I am still enjoying all five tracks (I hope you
                looked up the bonus track!) and I never would have found them on my own.
            </p>
<p>
                As it turns out, this week is also essentially guest hosted, as it has become "inverted." Three of
                the four are subscriber submissions; you guys make my job easy!
            </p>

                Pop | my future | Billie Eilish
            </h2>
<p>
                The moment it released last week, Rachel let me know that Billie Eilish had put out a new track. It was
                playing less than ten seconds later.
            </p>
<p>
                You certainly can't argue taste, but I'm not sure I understand disliking Billie Eilish at this point.
                Unless you like all your music to sound exactly the same and, therefore, can't stand Billie's unique
                vocal style or Finneas' rare, sometimes minimalist production, this music is so <i>refreshing.</i>
</p>
<p>
                As suggested by the track's title, Billie has fallen in love with her future and realized that
                she might not need someone else around to make her happy.
            </p>
<blockquote>
                I know supposedly I'm lonely now<br>
                Know I'm supposed to be unhappy<br/>
                Without someone<br/>
                But aren't I someone?<br/>
</br></blockquote>
<p>
                This one starts out with some jazzy, sultry vibes before moving into an almost lo-fi, bedroom pop grooviness
                that is an absolute delight. Whatever album these recently released singles will be a part of is
                going to be spectacular.
            </p>

                French Electro-Alt | Get Some | BLOW
            </h2>
<p>
                I found out about this track yesterday when Joe texted me an album saying,
                "The album <i>Vertigo</i> by 'BLOW' has some serious groove. It's very well mastered even if a little compressed."
                If I know anything, it's that when Joe sends me an album I listen to it.
            </p>
<p>
                Naturally, with this being from the very well defined genre known as electro-alt-pop-groove, the group is French.
                We all know that's where the best electro-anything comes from France and these
                four make the case even stronger.
                Honestly, it was incredibly challenging to select one track from the thirteen on the record. The album
                ebs and flows from electronic to alt-rock, meaning that it's really best experienced as a whole. However,
                I find myself addicted to the way they pluck the guitar on this one, especially in the solo at 2:06.
            </p>
<p>
                Loop it and I'd be happy for a long time.

                Contemporary Jazz | S3NS | Ibrahim Maalouf
            </h2>
<p>
                In one of our semi-regular living room listening sessions, Alex put this one on and I was stunned.
                I hadn't heard jazz this exciting since discovering "Snarky Puppy."
            </p>
<p>
                Born in Beirut, this French-Lebanese jazz trumpeter and composer got his start at age seven, encouraged
                by his father, who played the same instrument. As a duo, the two toured Europe and the Middle East,
                playing some well known and difficult pieces. Maalouf continued his career by playing soundtracks
                before making his own records, which he began doing in 2007.
            </p>
<p>
                This track comes from his most recent album and is, without a doubt, its highlight. I think you'll find
                it organic, well recorded, and vibrant.
            </p>

                Banger | Right Time | Hayden James, Icona Pop
            </h2>
<p>
                There's a high likelihood that you've heard from these artists before, but you simply must hear this track.
                When Tenzin showed me this from the Australian DJ, Hayden James, paired with the even better known Swedish duo, I was hooked.
            </p>
<p>
                It's a summer banger and that's all there is to it. It even does "that wavy thing" I'll never get enough of. Put it on and sit still; I dare you.
            </p>

<p>
                After establishing the wildly successful project, "Broods," Georgia and Caleb Nott each decided to venture
                into solo projects. Caleb called his "Fizzy Milk" and Georgia called hers "The Venus Project." However, hers
                wasn't just a solo project. As you can read more about at the link above,
                Georgia brought together fifteen women to produced a bold ten track album.
            </p>
<p>
                For the second time this week, it was a challenge to choose a single track from a record best
                enjoyed whole. "Won't Hurt" and "Need a Man" would have been equally good selections, but "Need/Want"
                shows off the experimental side of the album in its outro. I hope this glimpse convinces you to try
                out the rest of <i>Vol. 1,</i> which excites me for the suggestion that there will be a <i>Vol. 2.</i>
