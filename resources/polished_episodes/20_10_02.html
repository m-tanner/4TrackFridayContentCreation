                Yes yes yes, your favorite Tanner brother is back to guest host. I've got some good ones queued up for you this week.
                However, I was looking through the playlist the other day and I realized that there aren't any songs by Uighur Muslims living in Xinjiang in Northwest China.
                When I realized this, I was shocked. In fact, I had trouble sleeping.
            </p>
<p>
                In an effort to alleviate this painful injustice done by all previous 4TF hosts (myself included),
                I scoured the internet to find an absolute banger that only the most culturally sophisticated among us will understand.
                Let's get into it.

                The Best of Both Worlds (underrepresented hip hop and the underrepresented, overly oppressed Uighurs) | Paklansun Qelib by Six City
            </h2>
<p>
                First we have the song from the Uighur community out of China.
                If you aren't aware of the Uighurs' situation in China......well you should take a long look in the mirror and possibly reevaluate your priorities.
                The Chinese government has imprisoned more than one million people since 2017 and subjected those not detained to intense surveillance, religious restrictions, and forced sterilizations.
                Uighur culture is being systematically erased from China's past, present, and future.
                If you don't actively fight against this, discuss it with your friends/family, and bring it up at any opportunity, you're complicit in the Uighurs' oppression.

                Oh, you don't like the tone of this email? You're wondering wtf is going on? Same! So let's keep 4TF about music!

                Light-Hearted Indie Pop | Mistakes by Ryan Nealon
            </h2>
<p>
                For those that are still reading, congrats on making it this far!
                Next up we have a song that I absolutely fell in love with on first listen.
                In a previous episode, Nate and I featured one of our friends, J.B. Boone (along with three other songs that were......hip hop).
                This song is by one of J.B.'s friends from L.A. I'm pretty surprised this guy only has 50k monthly listeners because I had this one on repeat from the first time I heard it.
                Ryan's captivating voice and relatable lyrics make this a joy to listen to over and over again.

                Radically Rapturous Retrowave | After Dark by Mr.Kitty
            </h2>
<p>
                Third, we have my favorite of the week.
                I have been on a synthwave/retrowave/chillwave kick lately and this is the best song to come out of it which might be because I found it from this oddly mesmerizing
                <a href="https://youtu.be/waAlgFq9Xq8" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">video.</a>
                There's something about this song and synthwave/retrowave in general that just makes me kick my feet up on my desk and lose myself in the music (and for you climbers out there, it's a great genre to listen to while bouldering).

                PVRIS-esque anti-Pop | Guest Room by Echos
            </h2>
<p>
                The final song this week is a song that reminds me a lot of PVRIS which is, of course, a great thing.
                I think their website describes them perfectly so I'm just going to rip from that:
                "Echos, the Portland duo, fall into a genreless mist of both cinematic post-rock style instrumentation and left-of-center pop writing; paving a new path, and style along the way. Clash Magazine notes Echos are 'Oddly infectious... in an electronic haze.' Often self-referential and coated in bitter-romance lyricism, Echos brings the angst of 2006's emo days and reinvents it with 2018's anti-pop pop-music."
