                Hi everyone, I'm Nader.
            </p>
<p>
                Oh. Em. Jee. This is so cool.  Since its inception I've wanted to contribute to this epic project.  Big thanks to Tanner for the opportunity to share some music that I enjoy with you.
            </p>
<p>
                After perusing the incredible cumulative 4TF playlist I quickly realized that there is a genre that is very underrepresented - hip hop. Ironic--in a not-very-good way.  Also unfortunate, because hip hop is what I listened to almost exclusively in my formative years.  I want to shine a spotlight on a few of the countless black artists who have used the musical medium to powerfully capture the black experience.
            </p>

                Hip Hop | Cell Therapy | Goodie Mob
            </h2>
<p>
                Goodie Mob is an Atlanta-based group composed of Big Gipp, Khujo, Cee-Lo, and T-Mo that was most active in the 1990s.  This is one of their most popular songs and elegantly captures many facets of systemic racial inequality and its effects that so many of us have just recently become cognizant of.  I encourage everyone to look-up the lyrics to this song and try to picture the Atlanta that Goodie Mob paints with their words.  Remember while you listen that this song was released in 1995. Black people have been systematically oppressed for more than just our lifetimes.  There are many words that are just as relevant today as they were 25 years ago.  "Trained assassins do search and seize, ain't knockin' or askin'," wow, powerful.  This is especially painful given the recent decision by the Kentucky Attorney General not to charge the police officers who murdered Breonna Taylor.  We must continue to say her name and drive systemic change.

                Hip Hop | Sound of da Police | KRS-One
            </h2>
<p>
                KRS-One ascended to the forefront of the Bronx hip hop scene in the late 1980s as part of the group Boogie Down Productions.  Both of BDP's albums are hip hop classics that surely would have been followed by more excellence had DJ Scott La Rock not been murdered the year that they started releasing albums.  I imagine most people have heard the hook of this song in some shape or form, but I urge you to listen to each verse intently because the message KRS-One is urgently relaying is relevant now more than ever.  Many of KRS-One's songs focus on police brutality and racial injustice.  He is heralded as one of hip hop's best.

                Hip Hop | I Used to Love H.E.R. | Common
            </h2>
<p>
                Time to show Chi-town some love.  Today, it's more common to find Common in movies and on TV, but he still produces and writes music as well!  This song is hailed by many as one of the best hip hop songs of all time.  In the song he reflects on the 1990s shift (or degradation in some eyes) from afrocentric hip hop to the popularization of somewhat superficial mainstream hip hop.

                Hip Hop | Soapbox | CYNE
            </h2>
<p>
                Picking only four songs to share is very difficult.  I have only scratched the surface of hip hop - there's an entire ecosystem underground to explore.  I'll leave that for a future episode.  I would be remiss not to share one of my favorites with you:  CYNE.  The group met in Florida and have been producing music together for over a decade now.  Cise Starr is the MC, and Speck and Enoch produce.  They're a great example of a modern-day hip hop group that maintains a socially-conscious tone and thoughtful lyrics--not to mention their beats are also fire.  I had a hard time picking one CYNE song to share with you - so honorable mentions go to "Steady," "Haze," "Maintain," and "Pretty Black Future."  If you're left wanting more also check out Cise Starr's work with other artists such as Uyama Hiroto and Nujabes.
