<p>
                Hey friends,
            </p>
<p>
                I'm back this week to follow 4TF's most arrogant episode to date!
                You have to ask yourself, "What insecurities lie under all that
                confidence?" We might never know, but I <i>do</i> know I <i>was</i> addicted to
                last week's "Lion" for more than a few days...
            </p>
<p>
                Getting to this week's regularly scheduled programming,
                we've got tracks with &lt;1,000, 20K, 1M, and 8M plays!
                Tell me your favorite and I'll tell you how high you score on the
                hipster-meter. (My favorite is the 8M one, does that mean I lose?)
            </p>

                Drum 'n' Bass | Heatsink | imbi x slim set
            </h2>
<p>
                This Australian collab has been described by triple j's Ash McGregor as
                "chicken waffles - an intriguing combo, two distinct flavours, but works damn well together"
                and I couldn't agree more.
            </p>
<p>
                Rooted DJ Atro's clubby vibes,
                this trio finds a way to perfectly contrast imbi's glowing vocals against Uncle Kal's scorched bars.
                A rare combination, this track will satisfy bass heads and wordplay elitists alike.

                Sensual Soul | Love Is Rare | Morcheeba
            </h2>
<p>
                Months ago when I was preparing for a flight I asked Joe,
                "What albums should I explore on my cell-signal-free oasis?"
                He responded with a few wonderful records, one of them being
                Morcheeba's <i>Fragments of Freedom</i>. My first introduction
                to this duo's easy groove and gracious energy, I enjoyed every track
                on the record. One track, though, edged out the rest for my favorite:
                "Love Is Rare." It's lyrically confident and lusciously funkful.
                Accented throughout with perfectly placed guitars, horns, and more, Morcheeba's style is on full display.
            </p>
<p>
                This duo lands solidly amongst the
                lounge greats like Zero 7,
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_04_17.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">Télépopmusik</a>,
                and others. Take care with this one; music like this is rare.

                Dat Slink | Disco Man | Remi Wolf
            </h2>
<p>
                Staying funky, but turning towards pop we have a track that
                Lily introduced me to during a recent listening session.
                Let's just say that no one was still on the couch after it came on.
            </p>
<p>
                Remi Wolf is on a rocket to stardom, already touring and collaborating with other superstar
                acts like
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/19_08_30.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">Still Woozy</a>,
                and
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_03_06.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">BENEE</a>,
                and Florida's 25-year-old king, Dominic Fike.
                "Disco Man" along with her more recent singles like "Monte Carlo" and "Cheesin'" have my interest piqued for whatever is next!
            </p>
<p>
                Her next live show is scheduled to be at SF's Outside Lands. I don't know
                about you, but that was enough to get me to buy a ticket. See you there!

                Psych Pop | Heartbreak in Las Vegas | Medaila
            </h2>
<p>
                Online dating might not be good for much, but it's been good for
                me finding new music. Last week this one hit my inbox in response to my
                "first round is on me if you send me something amazing that has less than
                10k plays on Spotify" prompt. Color me impressed.
            </p>
<p>
                In fact, the whole album is fantastic. It does something that not enough
                albums do - playing as one continuous track, even beginning with the lyrics
                "let the show begin" and ending with "it's time to end the show" (before
                the premature applause transitions into an actual "encore" track).
            </p>
<p>
                This track in particular is the final "come downer," as the narrator laments:
                <blockquote>
                    But I burned that bridge until it crumbled down<br/>
                    Like everything I seem to touch<br/>
                    Our story reached the end<br/>
                    Way too soon to comprehend<br/>
</blockquote>
                Met with warbling horns and echoing production, the listener is totally drawn into
                the loneliness of the track, but in a way that feels more comforting than sad.
                (Maybe that's just me though.)
            </p>
<p>
                Right now, this record presents a much welcome opportunity to imagine you're
                at a live show, which I've enjoyed doing several times. Give <i>Good Lord Nancy</i>
                a listen!
            </p>

                Of course, don’t forget to reply with <i>what you liked, didn’t like, and what you’ve been listening
                to</i>.
