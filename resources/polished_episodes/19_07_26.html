                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we are, week four!
            </p>
            <p>
                Tanner is on retreat and left me the keys. So... hello everyone, I'm Joe. The songs featured this week
                are a pretty eclectic mix, but I wanted to keep them all inviting and fun. Let's get down to business.
            </p>

                Electronic Pop — Half Love by Red Hearse
            </h2>
            <p>
                Keep your eyes on these guys as an upcoming hit group. A new trio that includes Sounwave (producer for
                Kendrick Lamar) and Jack Antonoff (guitar/drums for fun. and a producer/writer for Taylor Swift, Lorde,
                St. Vincent and Lana Del Rey), Red Hearse has released three singles that are just good, solid pop. Half
                Love is a groovy power ballad, full of hooks and catchy lyrics. The music video features St. Vincent
                being a total bada** (though she always is), so check it out.

                Chill Club Pop — Swimming Pool by Millie Turner
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hailing from London and born this century, Millie has been releasing singles for the past couple years,
                all in a similar danceable-but-relaxed pop style. Swimming Pool is a little darker and simpler in its
                arrangement compared to her past work, and that is what makes it intriguing. Think of this as a song
                written by a Gen-Z possessed by Lana Del Rey and you'll get the idea.

                Jazz Swing/Fusion — It Dont Matter by Jacob Collier
            </h2>
            <p>
                Jacob Collier is hardly obscure with more than 380,000 subscribers on YouTube, several viral videos
                performing a capella arrangements of pop songs and a Grammy, but his Djesse project is too good to pass
                up as a mention. Djesse Vol. 1 was a fantastic listen, and Vol. 2 exceeds all expectations. The song
                taking the cake for energy and groove is It Dont Matter, which features incredible vocal runs and
                harmonizations alongside by upbeat instrumentation.

                Christian Rap — Caged Birds by Tobe Nwigwe
            </h2>
            <p>
                People can be cynical about Christian music, but this one is worth a try. Tobe was an NFL draft pick who
                turned to a career in music after an injury playing college football. His music features some clever
                word play and biblical references on top of some shifty, layered beats put together by his producer
                Nell. Tobe releases a video every Sunday, either a new single or an old song performed with live
                instrumentation. Caged Birds is one of Tobe's more recent releases and is featured here for its flow and
                rhyme
