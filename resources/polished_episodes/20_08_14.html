                Hi friends,
            </p>
<p>
                This week is pretty upbeat. Let's dive right in.

                Vocal Trance | Electric Glow - Arston Remix | Tritonal (feat. Skyler Stonestreet)
            </h2>
<p>
                If the sun tasted like ice cream, we would call it Tritonal. The duo from Austin, TX produces
                undeniably bright, delicious, and danceable music. They started out making trance music before slowly
                edging their way to a more progressive vibe. More recently, they've even forayed slightly
                into the "dubby" by producing tracks with Seven Lions and others. This one comes from the era when
                they began getting a bit more vocal, but were still deeply rooted in trance.
            </p>
<p>
                Catch this playing real loud in my living room today.

                House? | Like this | Park Hye Jin
            </h2>
<p>
                When I discovered Park I was immediately entranced. What is this genre? What is she doing?
                Why do I like this so much? How is her production quality so good?
            </p>
<p>
                This album released on the incredibly strong Ninja Tune label and
                is a massive departure from her first record. On this one, she pushes her musical boundaries to the limit,
                even failing to deliver a listenable track in one case. However, when it's good it's better than good
                and, more than anything else, it's <i>interesting.</i>

                Vocal Pop | meant to be. | will hyde
            </h2>
<p>
                With fewer than 60,000 plays on Spotify, you're in on the ground floor of this track. A delight to hear,
                this track reminds me of the immensely popular Harry Styles. Will is from Melbourne and destined for stardom.
            </p>
<p>
                I'll leave you with my favorite review of this track, which comes from triple j unearthed's Tommy Faith, "Will coming through with a major pop record right here! Also that bass line is my dad, no paternity test required."

                Indie Rock | The World and I | Bad Suns
            </h2>
<p>
                A while back I texted Scott, "I need something fresh and happy to listen to." Without missing a beat he fired
                back <i>Mystic Truth</i> from Bad Suns. It delivered.
            </p>
<p>
                Scott and I magically have the same favorite track from the record, on which the four-piece from California delivers a handful
                of polished gems. I can easily go a whole day with the album on repeat. I think you'll find it a refreshing
                dose of that 2010's indie vibe.
