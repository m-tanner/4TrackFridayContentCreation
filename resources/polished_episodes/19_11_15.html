                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                Alright, I'm sitting down at 6 p.m. on a Friday evening with a 26-song playlist. After my most
                "prolific" week
                of song discovery, I've got to narrow this down to four songs and actually write something about them.
                Wish me luck!
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, it's week 20! How many of you thought this would actually stick around? Cheers to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's dive into this week's offering.

                Surf-pop - Robbery by Lime Cordiale
            </h2>
            <p>
                Going by Lime Cordiale, Louis and Oli Leimbach hail from the northern beaches of Sydney.
                With intent, this duo delivers summer vibes any time of year. For those of us simultaneously in the
                northern hemisphere
                and an area where seasons exist (ruling out so-cal), I know we're missing those! Have no fear, Lime
                Cordiale is here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like a cross between Cat Empire and Dirty Heads, the brothers combine layer on layer of energetic sound.
                Heartbreak never sounded so happy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get robbed.

                Lo-fi - Flowers by In Love With a Ghost feat. Nori
            </h2>
            <p>
                After my recent visit to D.C., Joseph has me deep into lo-fi, which caused me to re-discover this track.
                In Love With a Ghost seems a solo project for one interesting guy in France. His pinned tweet says,
                "hello, i make
                weird electronic chill piano music." How self aware and spot on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I first discovered him back in 2017 and I remember showing Joe B., who hated the background sounds.
                Well... I love them, but I can see the crowd dividing over this. (Weigh in by replying to this email!)
            </p>
            <p>
                When I sit and listen to this track, I'm transported into a different place,
                perhaps the scene of a Studio Ghibli movie.
                (A scene from Whisper of the Heart is usually what becomes the
                visual on YouTube for this type of music.) In any case, it's splendid.
            </p>
            <p>
                This song is best enjoyed wrapped in a blanket with headphones. Or however you listen to music.
                Whatever.

                Acoustic pop - Bomb Song by Liz Bills
            </h2>
            <p>
                Last Saturday, in true Sofar fashion, I wandered into a stranger's living room to listen to three
                completely random artists. Luckily for me, it ended up being three wonderfully powerful female acts, all
                of which
                were named some form of "Elizabeth."
            </p>
            <p>
                The one that stole the show, though, was Liz Bills. I particularly connected to a
                song Liz plans to release on Mother's day. Mark your calendars and don't miss the album she plans to
                release next year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bomb Song is filled with energy and Liz's beautiful voice. However, her presence outshines everything
                and is truly unique.
                When she blows up and comes to a venue near you, don't miss it.

                Brooding electronica - Lilo by The Japanese House
            </h2>
            <p>
                The guest track of the week comes from someone who's quickly become a permanent co-host of this email,
                Rachel. Hi Rachel!
            </p>
            <p>
                Amber Bain released this album earlier this year, and it's a shame I've only found it now.
                Exhibiting elements of everything I love about vocalized electronica,
                Bain produces something melancholic, reflective, and soulful in "Lilo."
            </p>
            <p>
                She hits on themes of transition and impermanence using the image of a lilo, which is a
                type of inflatable mattress that's meant to lie on at the beach or in a pool. It's beautiful.
