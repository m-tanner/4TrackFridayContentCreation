<p>
                Hello hello,
            </p>
<p>
                Thank you to those of you that checked out <a href="https://myquarantine5.com/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">myquarantine5.com</a>!
                It's nice to see some people (22 of you) try it out without hearing about a bunch of immediate errors ðŸ˜Š
            </p>
<p>
                Last week, one of Jake's favorite 4TF alumni, Rachelle LaNae (previously known as Tacky Annie), released her first-ever solo album, which you can find
                on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/79CTfV9CqWHUFKWESv2e4z?si=ARIywsJ7T-ytSVGpApUZeg" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">Spotify</a>
                and <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/taking-back-me-ep/1514363868" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">Apple Music</a>.
                I know I'm looking forward to receiving my
                <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rachellelanae/rachelle-lanae-makes-a-solo-ep-taking-back-me" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">signed copy</a> of the album soon!
            </p>
<p>
                Jake also sent in one of the guest tracks that makes up what I hope you find to be an eclectic week. Let's get to it.

                Chill disco | Silver And Gold by Owl Eyes
            </h2>
<p>
                To my surprise, I've actually seen Brooke Addamo live as a vocalist for Flight Facilities, but this
                time around I found her on an album of her own, which released last week and follows her previously successful <i>Nightswim</i>.
            </p>
<p>
                It was hard to pick a track off this newest, which the Melbourne singer-songwriter wrote mostly in Belgium,
                but this track seemed to fit best with the week.
                It's got an anchoring bass line, a well layered mid range, and Addamo's wonderfully light vocals on top.
                This track is a smooth reminder that you can't purchase affection and one that I can't get enough of.

                Trap | WOW by KVKA
            </h2>
<p>
                Josh has told me for months that I need more music like this on 4TF. Luckily, I discovered this track
                this morning and perhaps it's just what the doctor ordered.
            </p>
<p>
                KVKA (pronounced "Kuka" after his birth name Mukuka) has been all around the world:
                born in Zambia, raised in the UK, started his musical career in New Zealand, and recently settled in Melbourne.
                He's put out a two albums and a bunch of singles, and it's clear he's able to deliver
                several sonic signatures.
            </p>
<p>
                This track leans towards trap, while something else like
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/Jw_Ue1NvahI" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">WHO YOU</a>"
                lands squarely as lyric-focused, powerful rap.
                Judging by his progression and recent attention from triple j, I know we can expect a lot more from KVKA soon.
            </p>

                Bergen wave | In Space by RÃ¶yksopp
            </h2>
<p>
                Hans sent me this song long ago and I've been waiting for a fitting moment to send it out. Well,
                its title and last weekend's SpaceX launch fit too perfectly to pass up.
            </p>
<p>
                The duo, formed by Svein Berge and TorbjÃ¸rn Brundtland in 1998, is named after the Norweigan word for
                "puffball mushrooms." Though they've released five other albums, their debut, <i>Melody A.M.</i>, remains
                one of their most widely acclaimed.
            </p>
<p>
                When I sat and listened to it over and over, this track managed to stand out
                from what is a very strong ten-track record.
                Its smooth strings, plucked harp, and organic drumming blend perfectly. It's one of those songs that
                encourages you to close your eyes and forget where you are, perhaps allowing you to imagine you're "in space."

                Pop | Ride My Bike by Maude Latour
            </h2>
<p>
                Like I mentioned, Jake sent me a track recently, saying, "You should check out <i>Starsick EP</i> from Maude Latour.
                Very strong Lorde vibes." Right-o, buddy!
            </p>
<p>
                Lorde and her album <i>Melodrama</i> has to be one of my favorite albums and this one from Latour definitely
                strikes whatever part of my brain likes this type of music. Admittedly, Michael Adubato's production isn't
                as sophisticated or flair-filled as Jack Antonoff's, but it's still easy to bump along to.
            </p>
<p>
                A sophomore at Columbia University, Latour hasn't decided whether she'll major in political science or
                philosophy, but she does know she'll be making music throughout it all. She currently manages
                her career alongside her ivy league workload by reading backstage and skipping statistics class. Her live
                shows started out small (only two people showed up once), but I think we can all expect to see her touring
                in our own cities within this decade.
