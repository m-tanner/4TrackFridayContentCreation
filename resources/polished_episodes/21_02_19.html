<p>
                Hey everyone,
            </p>
<p>
                Over the past two months, it's been wonderful to see where guest hosts and interviews
                have taken the playlist. I've really enjoyed all the new music to listen to!
                Big thanks to all of you:
                Rachel, DJ, Ash (x2), Elliot, Eric, Victoria, Alex, Cherry Tomato, Sundreamer, Joe, and Jake
                for contributing your time to sharing music here!
            </p>
<p>
                Since it's been so long, I have some exciting things to share before we jump into the music.
                Joseph used some of his recently acquired Python powers to make a word cloud
                of 4 Track's genre representation. The words are pulled directly from how artists label themselves
                in Spotify, so enjoy some of the wacky words in there!
            </p>

<p>
                Rachel also asked me for some smaller playlists and, with how big the playlist is getting,
                I can see why. I've chunked them by the hundreds on Spotify; enjoy!
            </p>

                Scottish Electropop | Graffiti | CHVRCHΞS
            </h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/MWa_MUuzzJk" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live for triple j</a>
<p>
                While certainly no hidden gem, I have been absolutely glued to the
                most recently released album of this Glasgow trio.
            </p>
<p>
                Something about Lauren Mayberry's ability to pipe in the upper registers contrasted
                against the deeply vibrant synths and keyboards of Iain Cook and
                Martin Doherty has me hooked. Top that with what many consider
                to be Mayberry's strongest songwriting and you have something that
                can truly capture your attention.

                Retrowave | Nightdrive | VHS Dreams
            </h2>
<p>
                After listening to a ton of CHVRCHES, I found myself wanting
                more. More synth, more bass, more... vibes!
                I texted Ash, "Hit me with your best bassy synth music."
                Immediately, I received a playlist from a legend named Kevin (Hi, Kevin!)
                and it was full of absolute bangers.
            </p>
<p>
                The UK-based VHS Dreams was a big part of the 2015 Retrowave movement
                and he's rather well known for the album from which this track
                comes, <i>TRANS AM</i>.
            </p>
<p>
                If you listen to this enough, you might find yourself... needing to go for a drive.

                Aussie Indie | Melbourne Weather | Josh Cashman
            </h2>
<p>
                Have you ever given a song warmth by literally beginning it with the sound of a
                campfire? Well, Josh Cashman has. It's fitting since he goes on to communicate in a way
                that I'd expect from a friend late at night, when only us, the stars, and some whiskey remain.
            </p>
<p>
                When I noticed he was featured on Tash Sultana's latest album (which released this morning!),
                I knew he must be worth exploring. With his dreamy production and cleverly calming lyrics,
                he didn't let me down.
            </p>
<p>
                This is the opening track to his late 2020 release, <i>Now I'm Twenty-Five</i>.
                As an album, it's filled with self reflection, perfectly sung melodies, and
                characteristically melancholic production. Without noticing you'll find
                yourself pulled into Cashman's orbit and I don't know about you,
                but I don't want to him to let me go.
            </p>

                Mexican Acoustic Rock | The Soundmaker | Rodrigo y Gabriela
            </h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/KV2ixprDrK8" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live on KEXP</a>
<p>
                Even though they are no longer together as a couple,
                Rodrigo y Gabriela make music that is nothing if not passionate.
            </p>
<p>
                A week ago, Tamas sent me the above-linked KEXP performance and
                I've listened to it at least three times since. This is the show's opening track
                as well as my favorite from their album, <i>9 Dead Alive</i>.
            </p>
<p>
                While the energy of the live performance is unforgettable, the
                mastering of the recorded version is equally so. Gabriela and her rhythmic
                guitar slapping positions itself in your left ear while Rodrigo's guitar-turned-voice serenades the right.
                The way this creates a dance in your headphones seems unrivaled to me, but please send
                me anything you find that's similar!
