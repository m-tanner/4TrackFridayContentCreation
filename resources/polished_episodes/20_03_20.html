                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm here to give you some music to dig into while you're on
                COVID-demanded house arrest. Mike W. will be here next week to do the same! He's got his tracks
                ready to go and I dig them. He's just got the writing left to do. We believe in you, Mike!
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm delighted that Hayley Williams put out a single from the second half of her
                upcoming album today. I already pre-ordered the vinyl box set and even accidentally picked up four
                tickets
                to her upcoming Seattle show. Let me know if you want one!
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's jump into this week's four, which I've really enjoyed over the past week or so. Also, I'm sleeping
                on
                a bunch of tracks right now, so <b>please let me know which genre(s) you'd like to hear most on April
                3rd</b>:
                pop, electro, hip hop, ska, rock, or something else.
            </p>

                Punchy rock | Second by Hope D
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/We-iHJBXyyQ" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Interview and
                live performance</a>
            <p>
                If I can only use one word to describe this track it's "infectious." They way this track perfectly
                builds to its final minute is shocking. Beginning with light guitars and clearly clever lyrics,
                Hope D jumps into an energetic hook that makes you realize she's got some intensity on the track.
                After sinking back into calmer verses her voice bites harder and harder until she
                pins you the the wall with her absolute attack in the final one where the energy rises until it
                completely
                matches the hook, leading you straight off the track's cliff-like end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hope Defteros is a super fresh artist out of Brisbane and "Second" is only her second released track,
                though she has more for her live shows. Writing and playing music since the age of nine,
                she's been performing incessantly since she turned eighteen. She's competed in and won many
                competitions, even earning a spot at last year's Splendor in the Grass festival.
            </p>
            <p>
                You're in at the beginning with Hope and I don't know about you, but I <i>can't wait</i> to
                hear what else comes our way from her.

                Softcore reggae | Kiki by The Shang
            </h2>
            <p>
                Hopefully summer is approaching wherever you live. If it is, head outside and put this song on. If it
                isn't,
                put it on anyway and just close your eyes.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Shang (a band very annoying to google since they share their moniker with a Chinese dynasty),
                are a four-piece hailing from southwest Sydney. Reminding me of the ethos of Tunnel Vision with
                the sound of Sticky Fingers, these guys know how to kick it. They're funny enough that I'll paste this
                bit from their bio here. Describing their own critical reception, they write, "With praise from industry
                heavyweights,
                such as their own parents, their heavily obliged mates, and further heavily obliged significant others,
                The Shang are thought to be setting down a path travelled by many, but conquered by few."
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's hope they conquer the path and bring us more music.

                Pop poetry | Good Girl by Eluera
            </h2>
            <a href="https://genius.com/Eluera-good-girl-lyrics" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Lyrics</a>
            <p>
                Let me know if I'm putting out too much pop, but I can't help sharing this one just because
                of how stunning the lyrics are. Have you ever been in either position described on the track?
                Eluera makes you think about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a straightforward production, Eluera highlights her own voice and contemplations. In an interview
                she said,
                "I write everything so dark... I love moody progressions and any song that makes you feel
                some sort of intense emotion..." This one's definitely dark and moody.
            </p>
            <p>
                She's already released a bunch of singles, so check those out while we wait on a full-length album.

                Folk rock | It's Called: Freefall by Rainbow Kitten Surprise
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/QAVM_aooRrM" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live in NYC</a>
            <p>
                We're rounding out this week with an absolute delight from Joe. Having each recently bought new
                headphones,
                we each feel like we're hearing a lot of music for the first time no matter how many times we've heard
                it before. In the course of sharing our favorite recordings, Joe told me I needed to
                checkout Rainbow Kitten Surprise's 2018 album, <i>How to: Friend, Love, Freefall</i>. Dear god is
                the recording quality high on this. Recorded live, they capture a lot of organic energy with
                sound stage that's nothing but real. On a strong album, this one still manages to stand out; it's
                easily the most deliciously harmonized.
            </p>
            <p>
                This group is made up of five members out of North Carolina and is known for spurts of
                rapping, layered harmonies, heavy guitar riffs,
                and an overall unique sound that seems to be captured in their ridiculous band name.
                Sam Melo's vocals, which are often backed by the guitarist, Derrick Keller, are easy to love for
                the entire length of the album, which enjoyably bounces around from clever to playful to serious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not sure if they are coming out with a new album anytime soon, but they are touring this year.
                Rachel tells me their live set is incredible, so be sure not to miss them if they stop by your city!
