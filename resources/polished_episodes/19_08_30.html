                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                After Scott’s beautiful week eight, I’m back with a plain-text week nine :)
            </p>
            <p>
                I know that I said week seven was the most difficult week so far, but this one was even more so!
            </p>
            My channels for discovering new music have really come together since we started doing this two months ago
            (especially as you’ve sent me new playlists and podcasts to try) and many of you have also been engaging
            more and more by sending in your top tunes, which I appreciate so much. We’ve got a good thing going here.
            <p>
                While we’re on such a great streak, I have a small challenge for all of you: forward this to one person
                you think would enjoy one of the songs. If you like the weekly email, maybe someone else would like the
                chance to join, too!
            </p>
            On to new music. Some artists we’ve already heard have recently released new music. I suggest you check out
            edapollo’s debut album, which came out yesterday, and Clairo’s new single, which was collaboratively
            produced with Mura Masa.
            <p>
                I also recently found these tracks. They don’t quite fit into Four Track, but you should absolutely
                dedicate fourteen minutes to an uninterrupted listen.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that, let’s feast on this week’s menu.
            </p>

                Bedroom soul — Sushi in Tokyo by DVNA
            </h2>
            <p>
                My favorite track of the week comes from a new act out of a Gold Coast, Australia bedroom. DVNA
                (pronounced “Dana”) fuses new age soul and electronica in the freshest of ways and I am hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                Dana absolutely struts this baseline and her confidence is palpable. As you get to the hook for the
                first time, you’ll find yourself infected with the urge to move, if not outright dance.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you listen to this one, do me a favor and imagine this is what’s on the other side of Shawn
                Mendes’ Lost in Japan. Am I on to something? You tell me.

                Dance flavored alternative — Something Good by Pacific Avenue
            </h2>
            <p>
                Have you met someone new recently? Are you feelin’ it? If so, Pacific Avenue is here to put some words
                to your feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also from a coastal part of Australia, this track came out just a couple weeks ago as the final song on
                their first EP, Strawberry Skies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The band explains that this EP "tells the story of living out of home for the first time, and the
                vulnerability, the freedom, and the wild times that come with it” and that "'Something Good',
                encapsulates this feeling as a whole.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I think they nailed it, but give the song a listen and see for yourself.

                Garage soultronica — Habit by Still Woozy
            </h2>
            <p>
                Grace sent me Still Woozy, the alias of Sven Gamsky, and I was hooked. He may toil on these tracks alone
                in his Oakland, CA garage, but his groove is polished and oh-so-catchy.
            </p>
            <p>
                His sixth single and part of his EP from May, Habit is Grace’s favorite from Gamsky right now. It
                highlights just how perfectly he mixes the electronic and the acoustic into delicious audio cheesecake.
                On top of it all, he keeps a tight rhythm with his lyrics, even including some clever wordplay.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can’t wait to see how this sound evolves and grows as we get more and more music from Gamsky’s garage.

                Folk rock — Dougou Badia by Amadou &amp; Mariam ft. Santigold
            </h2>
            <p>
                Stephanie found this song while watching The Package and she says it’s become her go-to
                driving-to-an-adventure track.
            </p>
            <p>
                With it’s safari vibe, combining Santigold’s signature blend of pop, rock, and sass behind the married
                couple that goes by Amadou &amp; Mariam, who have produced music together out of Mali for decades, I can
                see why.
            </p>
            <p>
                This one was my taste-breaker for the week and I’m eager to hear what you think of it.
