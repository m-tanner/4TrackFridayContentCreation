                Hi friends,
            </p>
<p>
                I'm really excited to bring you this episode. Three of the four songs are discoveries from this week
                (one even released this morning)! The other one is something I've wanted to send for a while and today feels like a great day to finally do it.
                I think the week has come together with some great variety.
            </p>

<p>
                Today we also have two albums out from 4TF alumni! PVRIS finally released their much
                anticipated <i>Use Me.</i> Many of you enjoyed "Death of Me," and you have a lot to look forward to
                with the rest of this stellar album.
            </p>

<p>
                Another highly-anticipated album (for which I pre-ordered autographed vinyl) is out today and that's
                Kaleida's <i>Odyssey.</i> The duo's production quality has always been good, but this new album takes it
                to a whole new level. They focused on bringing together an "audiophile" experience and met the challenge with
                absolute success. Just when I thought "Tropea" was as good as it could get, "Other Side" redefines how room-filling sound can be.
                As an added bonus, I just attended Kaleida's own listening party, which
                they hosted on Zoom. Along with 30 other people, I was able to ask questions and listen to the tracks alongside
                the artists' own explanations and stories in a rare way.
                I hope to turn the experience into 4TF's second interview. Cross your fingers
                for me and they might even be open to spending some time to add some additional color!
            </p>

                Dubby | Too Busy | NOY (feat. Sophiegrophy)
            </h2>
<p>
                Released today, this song pushes the limits of my taste and that's exactly why I love it.
                Sophiegrophy is Nigerian born, New Zealand raised, and now Australia based artist who focuses on New Wave
                Hip Hop and club bangers while Noy is a Brizzy based bass head. Together they bring us this absolute slapper
                that gives me everything I need to go into the weekend with all the party vibes I didn't know I needed.
                You may not be able to hit the club, but you can definitely turn the lights out in your living room and pretend.

                Despairing optimism | 26 | Paramore
            </h2>
<p>
                This song is dear to me and I hope you can hear why. From the Tennessee band's fifth studio album,
                this song is an emotional masterpiece with an arrangement of seldom-matched quality. For those of you
                only familiar with Paramore's earlier tracks like "Misery Business" and "Still into You," this one might
                come as a bit of a surprise.
            </p>
<p>
<i>After Laughter</i> is easily the happiest sounding, yet most depressing album I know of.
                "Hard Times" strikes an incredible contrast between its poppy, bouncing marimbas and reflections
                on life's most difficult moments.
            </p>
<p>
                This track, though, takes the opportunity to match the mood and the sound, creating a track
                that can easily bring you to tears if you let it.
                Its climax comes in the following verse:
            </p>
<blockquote>
                Reality will break your heart<br>
                Survival will not be the hardest part<br/>
                It's keeping all your hopes alive<br/>
                All the rest of you has died<br/>
                So let it break your heart
            </br></blockquote>
<p>
                Decide for yourself what the track means to you, but to me it suggests that it's not about surviving life,
                but remaining hopeful and vulnerable. It's a musical reminder that I cherish every time I hear it and I
                hope you like it too.
            </p>

                French disco-house | No More Tears | Modjo
            </h2>
<p>
                Next up we have a fitting track to follow Hayley, Josh, Taylor, and Zac. The first of two tracks this
                week that I discovered thanks to Emily, this one is from the French house producer Romain Tranchart and vocalist Yann Destagnol.
                The duo's "Lady - Hear Me Tonight," was their first-ever single. Unsurprisingly,
                that track was created with heavy influence and guidance from Thomas Bangalter, best known as
                half of Daft Punk.
            </p>
<p>
                Romain learned music when he began playing classical, jazz-inspired tunes on his guitar where he lived
                in Brazil. However, he quickly became interested in house music and began experimenting with making it
                himself. He decided to study music in Paris, where he met Yann.
                Yann had learned to play flute and clarinet at a very young age and was subsequently deeply influenced by
                pop acts with strong voices like David Bowie and Queen.
            </p>
<p>
                "Lady" came together quickly during the two's early recording sessions and they eventually created a
                full record together, which has the signature marks of French house, disco, and other such grooviness.
                Unfortunately for us, they each started off on solo careers after the album was finished. However,
                I'm thankful we have this - an album that withstands being played on repeat for several days.
            </p>
<p>
                "No More Tears" stands out as the record's most lyrical track and brings out the best in the duo's
                expressiveness. You can hear Romain's production easily carry a song that lasts over six minutes while also
                enjoying Yann's vocal range and songwriting. Perfect for relaxing on an evening, I hope you dig this one.
            </p>

                Modern piano | Black Earth | Fazıl Say
            </h2>
<p>
                The second suggestion from Emily is this week's final track and is something I never would have stumbled upon myself.
            </p>
<p>
                Fazıl was a prodigy from a young age. He showed impressive math skill at the age of two, played piano at the age of three, and wrote his first
                sonata at the age of fourteen.
                He continued to write many pieces while studying music in Ankarta before stepping into the life of a professional musician.
                He then wrote scores for
                much larger arrangements, including the Istanbul Symphony, and enjoyed incredible critical reception.
            </p>
<p>
                On this track, which was released in 2016, he returns to the piano alone takes the listener
                on a journey. The track is quite experimental in certain segments
                (reminding me of <a href="https://youtu.be/izhGLGPmvIU" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">Nils Frahm</a> a bit)
                as manually manipulates the piano's strings.
                It's <a href="https://youtu.be/KG9wifgWdAQ" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">a joy to watch</a> and I highly recommend
                you take the time to see it for yourself.
            </p>

                Of course, don’t forget to reply with <i>what you liked, didn’t like, and what you’ve been listening
                to</i>.
            </p>

                And, as always, this week’s tracks are added to the collectors for all weeks' tracks on
