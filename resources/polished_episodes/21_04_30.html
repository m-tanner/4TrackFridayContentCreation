                Hello friends,
            </p>
<p>
                I've accidentally written an episode full of songs that would be just as fitting for a
                Valentine's Day episode. But to those of you that will undoubtedly ask, no I'm not seeing anyone
                new. It's just where this week of music took me ðŸ˜‰
            </p>
<p>
                In fact, three of this week's tracks are community submissions. Maybe we should be asking Tamas, Joe, and Spencer: are <i>you</i> in love?!
            </p>

                Cotton Candy | Bindii Patch | Abby Bella May
            </h2>
<p>
                This track has been on my radar and in my headphones since it released as a single a couple
                weeks ago ahead of the today-released album <i>I Am Sensitive</i>. It continues
                the thread of Australian pop that I've been into and sharing. (Remember Lola Scott and Beso Palma?)
            </p>
<p>
                The lyrics are simple and catchy. The vocal performance is undeniably sweet. It's all surrounded by a
                production that's just short of shiny.
                And that lack of complete sparkle is a positive to me, keeping the track
                feeling a little more real, just like the relationship problems it's describing.
            </p>
<p>
                This Sydney-based "lo-fi dream pop" star is headed for the clouds. Or the weeds. Either way, now
                you have the chance to be there with her.

                Soulful Americana | Hypotheticals | Lake Street Dive
            </h2>
<p>
                In interviews, Hayley Williams has described her inability to write love songs. On her newest album,
                <i>FLOWERS for VASES / descansos</i>, she even laments on "Trigger," "All I ever had to say about love is a sad song / I get off on telling everybody what went wrong."
                She's said that she doesn't worry about this because so many other groups take care of describing love going well.
            </p>
<p>
                Enter Lake Street Dive's "Hypotheticals." It is one of the most flowering, soulful, and happy tracks about newfound love I've come across
                and it's had me in the best of moods.
            </p>
<p>
                This song came my way in response to a message, "hit me with some music," to which Tamas fired back
                <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/990879183/lake-street-dive-tiny-desk-home-concert" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">this tiny desk</a>.
                This is first song from that performance and I was immediately hooked.
            </p>
<p>
                It's production is bliss, with instruments as far left and far right as they can get
                in the subtlest moments. The groove of the <i>string</i> bass, the zappy tremolo of the
                keyboard, and the outright spectacular vocals leave you energized and wanting more.
            </p>
<p>
                Lucky for us, this Boston-based group has released no less than five studio albums. The next couple weeks,
                you'll find me diving deep into that discography. Obviously.

                Summer Disco | Cruel Sexuality | La Roux
            </h2>
<p>
                After listening to "Bulletproof" and "In For The Kill" on the radio in high school,
                I thought I knew La Roux. Over a decade later, Joe pointed out how wrong I was
                when he recommended her 2014 <i>Trouble In Paradise</i>.
            </p>
<p>
                The whole album reveals a much groovier, less electronic production that I enjoy so much more.
                Something that continues to stand out to me on each listen is just how much <i>depth</i>
                there is on the production. At times it feel like elements of the track are so
                <i>far away</i>. As some elements come forward, others are shifted back in a way that
                makes me feel as though I'm swirling in the track. This alone will draw you in, which then allows
                the woeful lyrics to connect that much more.
            </p>
<p>
                Pretty soon Elly Jackson will have captured you and you'll be wondering, "Am I a fool to let you trouble me? Cruel sexuality..."

                Uplifted Blues | Running Away | Joey Dosik
            </h2>
<p>
                The dedicated readers amongst you will recognize this track from the
                previously Spencer-submitted and shared
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv4wf7bzfFE&amp;t=1778s" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline" target="_blank">Vulfpeck Live video</a>.
                While not a "member" of Vulf, Joey Dosik <i>is</i> a frequent collaborator. In fact,
                the partnership runs in the opposite direction, too. Theo Katzman played congos on this recording!
            </p>
<p>
                Dosik, though, is a solo artist in his own right and, even though he's only released one EP
                and another album, it couldn't be more obvious that he's incredibly talented. An expert
                vocalist, keyboard player, and saxophonist, he's more than capable of delivering deeply soulful
                jazz vibes on any track.
            </p>
<p>
                If you find yourself or a past partner running away from love, you'll know what
                Dosik means on this one.
