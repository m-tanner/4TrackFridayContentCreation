                Hi friends,
            </p>
<p>
                Last week's tracks were party ready, dance inducing tunes perfect for the summer sunshine. This week,
                we have a menu filled with more introspective, slower tunes that are better for cloudy skies and
                reflection. I hope you enjoy them just as much!
            </p>

                Singer/songwriter | Burned Out | dodie
            </h2>
<p>
                A staple entry in the catalog of current female singer/songwriters, Dorothy Clark
                began her music career by playing piano and ukulele covers on YouTube. In 2016, however, she released
                her first EP, <i>Intertwined</i>, before 2019 brought us <i>Human</i>.
            </p>
<p>
                I recently rediscovered Dodie in her when she uploaded a <a href="https://youtu.be/JWs5kbSQCr0" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">lo-fi demo</a>
                on her "doddleoddle" YouTube channel,
                which I recommend you check out. I picked this track from all the possibilities, though, for its vulnerability.
                It seems to be about her experience as a YouTube star with so many viewers, but I'm sure you can map it
                onto the times you've felt burnt out yourself, which is what makes this song so great!
            </p>

                Progressive rock | Nightmare | Polyphia
            </h2>
<p>
                Tenzin sent me <a href="https://youtu.be/EVSqUl-FtCI" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">this YouTube video</a>
                over two years ago and we were recently reminded of it in a guitar heavy listening sesh.
            </p>
<p>
                A duo from Dallas, these two really <i>shred.</i> This track stands out to me from their
                discography for its meandering musicality. Many of their tracks have insanely difficult guitar passages
                and high energy, but this one is unique for the way it weaves in and out of a slower melody. It also
                happens to be one of their better produced songs, meaning it'll play better if you have nice speakers
                or headphones.

                Electro indie pop | Oh! | Vallis Alps
            </h2>
<p>
                Another recent redisovery for me, this track from Vallis Alps has one of my favorite lines in any song:
                "I'm building a runway for a paper plane." It grabs my attention every time and somehow strikes me
                emotionally when placed alongside the rest of the track.
            </p>
<p>
                After getting their start in Seattle, the duo currently reside in Sydney, Australia. They released their
                first music together in 2015 and, unfortunately, haven't released anything in the last three years.
                Maybe if we all put "a new album from Vallis Alps" on our Christmas lists, they'd make a new one. It's
                worth a try!

                Electronica | Nordkap | Christian Löffler
            </h2>
<p>
                Corey showed me this German musician a few weeks ago and I absolutely fell in love. His ability to
                create perfectly produced, mesmerizing tracks is a delight. His use of organic elements, like the
                marimba in this one, mixed with low bass and several rhythms creates an undeniably cerebral sound.
            </p>
<p>
                A go-to for coding or chilling on the couch, you can find me listening to Löffler quite a lot.
