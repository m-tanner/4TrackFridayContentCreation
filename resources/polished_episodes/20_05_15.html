                Hi friends,
            </p>
<p>
                I wasn't ready for this, but here we go! Joseph and I talked about him doing this week,
                but obviously that didn't happen. He'll host next week, though!
            </p>
<p>
                Luckily, I have a 250 song playlist of songs that haven't made
                it onto 4Track yet and I've been listening to it when I play Rocket League. So, without further ado,
                I bring you the four songs that stuck out to me the most in the past week of playing
                flying car soccer!
            </p>

                Reggae rock hip hop | Spread Too Thin by Dirty Heads
            </h2>
<p>
                I can't have summer without the Dirty Heads and this one has had me singing along every time.
                It's a funny song to listen to right now, since it's about feeling burnt out from being busy. I find, though,
                that I feel just as burnt out right now from having nothing to do, so the song still delivers its healing effect.
            </p>
<p>
                The song has tons of energy, which comes from their wonderfully full instrumentation. With three vocalists,
                a guitarist, percussion, drums, bass, and keys, they really pack the track. Their versatility becomes even more apparent when
                you listen to this next to one of their other offerings, like
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/30eLfKHZEgI" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Medusa</a>."
            </p>
<p>
                Close your eyes and let this song transport you to Dirty Heads' home of Huntington Beach.

                Minimalist dream pop | Tropea by Kaleida
            </h2>
<p>
                If you've seen <i>John Wick</i>, then you already know this English duo by their breakout track
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/1CurN2Fg-2E" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Think</a>."
                However, there's lots more where that came from. This one manages to stick out to me through the mess of RL and, considering how downtempo it is,
                that's really saying something.
            </p>
<p>
                This track comes from Christina Wood and Cicely Goulder's debut EP, which released two years
                after they formed as an act. Since then, they've toured quite a bit in Europe, released another EP, which was followed by
                a full-length album. Lately, they've been uploading live home recordings to their
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KALEIDAMUSIC/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Facebook page</a>
                as a preview for the full tracks they plan to upload to YouTube after cancelling their upcoming live shows.

                Hip pop | Mai Elle by Planet Vegeta
            </h2>
<p>
                I mean, this song just <b>bangs</b>. This trio from Sydney has fewer than 40,000 monthly listeners on Spotify,
                but it won't be that way for long. With this as their second release, we can expect a lot from these three
                and you're in on the ground floor.

                French indie | Les Tropiques by La Belle Vie
            </h2>

<p>
                Once upon a time, nightlife was lively and youths frequently found themselves sharing cocktails
                at chic spots. It was in these fairy tale circumstances that Lauren and I discovered this track at one
                of Ballard's cutest bars. The bar owner was playing music from her private collection and we found
                ourselves constantly delighted.
            </p>
<p>
                Siri couldn't identify them all, but she got this one. Good thing, because a love song about going to Bali
                sounds prettttttttty nice right now.
