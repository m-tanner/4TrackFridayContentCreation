                Hi friends,
            </p>
<p>
                After last week's pop flavor, I wanted to see how much variety I could get into this week's episode.
                After googling and sifting through search results for
                <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/us/features/50-albums-audiophiles" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">"best mastered albums,"</a>
                I landed on the first three tracks you find here, while the fourth was a total surprise.
            </p>
<p>
                With RayJ hosting next week's and Ash ringing in 2021 immediately after,
                this will be my last episode of the year!
                Thus, I'd like to take this time to invite you to offer your thoughts on 4TF's 2020 with
                <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LPKJM83" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">this different, yet still short survey.</a>
                In it, I ask for your 2020 favorites, what you wish had been on the playlist, and any other feedback
                you might have.
            </p>
<p>
                As always, thank you for listening, sharing, and participating in what
                continues to be such a fun way to explore music and the world it embodies.
            </p>

                Underground | What's the Altitude | Cut Chemist (feat. Hymnal)
            </h2>

                "Said have you heard this sound? / I think I've heard this one / It's totally underground"
            </p>
<p>
                As I was listening to Cut Chemist's 2006 album, <i>The Audience's Listening,</i> its middle two
                tracks caught my ear the most, the above line especially. The bond over sharing music is central
                to the track's newfound and wavering love, which I enjoyed because of how central
                sharing music is to this project as well as some of my deepest friendships.
            </p>
<p>
                Louis MacFadden, an American DJ and producer known for being one of the best turntablists out there,
                really shows off his crate digging, musicality, and ability to highlight a vocalist on this track.
                And Hymnal's bars are well worth highlighting. His wordplay and storytelling are incredibly satisfying
                from beginning to end. This has restored my interest in acts like DJ Shadow and RJD2, the former I
                realized put out an incredible album last year that I missed. You'll be hearing from that soon.

                Psych Rock | Inertiatic Esp | The Mars Volta
            </h2>
<a href="https://genius.com/The-mars-volta-inertiatic-esp-lyrics" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Lyrics</a>
<p>
                "Who are the two artists you'd listen to for the rest of your life?" Zaseck's answer was a confident
                "Syd Arthur and The Mars Volta." I hadn't thought about this in a couple years, but then The Mars Volta's
                <i>Deloused in the Comatorium</i> found itself on the aforementioned list of albums and I excitedly gave it a fresh listen.
            </p>
<p>
                This track's energy is as undeniable as its lyrics are gruesome. According to Genius,
                the album as a whole tells the story of a man named Cerpin Taxt,
                who is lying in a comatose state and hallucinating from an overdose of morphine and rat poison.
            </p>
<p>
                However, I usually make it through the track without noticing the lyrics other than the hook,
                preferring to focus on the precise, well-staged percussion, absolutely ripping guitar riffs,
                and the vocal melody. Unfortunately, a key band member died just after this album, but even if this was
                all they ever made (and it isn't; they've made five since) it would still be a wonderful
                contribution to music.

                Neo-classical | For - Peter - Toilet Brushes - More | Nils Frahm
            </h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/Aln6DztAsMQ" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live</a>
<p>
                Nils is one of those artists that I've wanted to share ever since Alex and I saw him live on his <i>All Melody</i> tour,
                but, given the length of his tracks, I never knew how I'd share something without significantly decreasing the playlist's "shuffle-ability."
                Well, after I re-listened to his <i>Spaces,</i> I'll pay the price.
            </p>
<p>
                This 17-minute masterpiece is best witnessed via the live recording above (the same audio as you hear on the album).
                This track is spectacular for the way in which you get to hear several of Nils' styles all
                in one place: the sweeping electronic, the acoustic, and the wacky (who hits his piano like this?).
                Of course, this one will require a bit of attention, but I think you'll find it worthwhile.

                Ensemble | HOP | Brendan Eder Ensemble
            </h2>
<p>
                This is a late-breaking change to this week's episode, but one I couldn't resist. After
                Shawn sent me this group's cover of Aphex Twin's "#20," I checked out what else they had to offer
                and still haven't recovered from the delight this track induces.
            </p>
<p>
                This six-piece band was recruited to play together by, you guessed it, Brendan Eder and includes
                drums, synths, sax, flute, bassoon, clarinet, and electric bass. I've never heard these instruments
                sound quite like this and all I want is more.
