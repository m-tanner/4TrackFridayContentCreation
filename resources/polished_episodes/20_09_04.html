                Hi friends,
            </p>
<p>
                This week was fun to put together because I discovered all of these songs quite organically. These artists
                have collaborated with favorites, performed live at shows I attended, or were played by a guest at
                a home listening sesh. Let's dig in!
            </p>

                Lo-fi | tacenda | JVLY
            </h2>
<p>
                Kayle Butler is an lo-fi producer based in Newcastle, Australia and he recently released a collaboration
                with someone I know you've all heard of before:
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_01_17.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">edapollo.</a>
</p>
<p>
                However, this isn't that track. This comes from an album Kayle released earlier this year that I've seen
                best described as "fragmented, fractured, AND smooth." I know how much many of you enjoy lo-fi while you
                work or read and I'd encourage you to listen through the whole record.
            </p>

                Sensual pop | Sweetest Thing | Smoke Season
            </h2>
<p>
                Wongo and Blak Trash have easily held the top spot
                on the 4 Track playlist for "best song to sex to" for over a year,
                but I was recently reminded of this LA duo and they are here to make it a contest.
            </p>
<p>
                Sitting on the floor of the TOMS headquarters' concert space in Playa Vista (yes, the
                shoe brand has a concert space), I remember witnessing one of the most energetically sensual acts I've ever seen.
                Gabby Bianco and Jason Rosen have been making music together since 2013 and
                describe their own sound as "[presenting] the duo as distinct individuals, adept lovers, and powerhouse performers,"
            </p>
<p>
                Let me know which track you think deserves the top spot.

                Bedroom grunge | I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus | beabadoobee
            </h2>
<p>
                Last year something truly rare occurred. I went to a show and the opener was... good. Really good.
            </p>
<p>
                Clairo, an act which you'll recall is known for deeply personal "bedroom pop," toured alongside
                the undeniably grungy yet equally raw act led by Bea Kristi. I can more-or-less guarantee
                that you've heard her track, <a href="https://youtu.be/64JyKBf7kyE" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">"death bed (coffee for your head),"</a>
                which was a clever remix of Kristi's early release, "Coffee."
            </p>
<p>
                However, Kristi's band brought a much different sound to this live show, playing smashers like "She Plays Bass" alongside
                more garage-esque ones like this. What I enjoy most about this track is its slow burn
                where you can hear certain pieces of the arrangement stick out from the whole piece similar to what you
                might expect from a work of modern art. Except this time it's enjoyable.
            </p>

                Indie guitar | Pretty Lady | Tash Sultana
            </h2>
<p>
                Isa played this for me during a listening session a couple days ago and changed my life. Others, namely
                Jackie and Joe, had always recommended I listen to more Tash, but somehow I never got around to listening to much more
                than "Jungle" and <i>Flow State.</i> Returning to "Pretty Lady," I can hear how much the artist's sound has progressed
                and just how clean their production is. You can hear so much space throughout the track and the way
                their fingers lightly scrape the guitar strings during chord changes give it a distinctly human element and
                make it an audiophile's delight.
            </p>
<p>
                Tash is a solo artist from Australia who made massive waves after releasing
                homemade videos on YouTube. In fact, my first exposure to the artist was a
                <a href="https://youtu.be/dpFdHub8XpY" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">performance</a> of their own track on triple j.
            </p>
<p>
                You watch a whole track get built right before eyes by a single person. There's nothing quite like it and it's the
                reason they headlined so many festivals last year. Tash is currently working on their second studio album
                and I know many of us eager anticipate it.
