                Hey Everyone,
            </p>
            <p>
                Kyle here as this week's excited host!
                In quintessential fashion for a 69th episode,
                you've got yourself a virgin host ready to plow into some music.
                Let's just hope that I can keep a handle on things and make it through all four tracks before my
                excitement gets the best of me ðŸ˜‰.
            </p>
            <p>
                When Tanner asked me to host for my first time,
                I was very nervous about finding some of my favorite music that might be new for you all.
                So, I'm going to put a gamut of musical styles this week in the hopes that at least one track hits a new
                spot for each of you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Without further ado, assume your favorite ready position to take this week's lineup.
            </p>

                Mello Electro | Right To It | Louis the Child (feat. Ashe)
            </h2>
            <p>
                During a Quinn XCII concert last year, I ended up completely mesmerized by the vocal style and
                performance of the opener, Ashe. Her ability and willingness to bend notes and rhythms flashed me back
                to the best of Florence + The Machine.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this track, Louis the Child create the perfect reggae-esque groove for Ashe's loose and percussive
                vocal persona to shine. She isn't just singing; her voice melts in and out of the beat as if she's
                almost in a trance. Her performance pulls me in as it effortlessly moves between hip-hop, reggae, and
                sultry jazz. Let your shoulders drop into a luscious shimmy as you surrender to the vibe.

                Synth Pop | Recover | The Naked And Famous
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Naked and Famousâ€™ latest album evolves their previous sound into a more folksy, instrumental
                derivative. And I've got to say that I'm hooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                This headline track for the album grounds itself in a reflection on finding oneself after losing a loved
                one. Gone are the heavy handed electronic backbeats and synthesized rhythms of their old music. Instead,
                the heart of the sound comes from a light piano lullaby intertwined with deep half-time bass roots. The
                vocal performance echoes from a choral stylistic base and almost floats itself over the beat like a
                beloved memory. The group has done amazingly well to capture the essence of what it feels like to go
                through loss.

                Jazz | Walking Through New Orleans | Pete Fountain
            </h2>
            <p>
                For this third track, we're going back in time to the man who essentially defined the New Orleans style
                of jazz on his own. If you've never heard of him before, his name is Pete Fountain, and he is one of the
                most underrated jazz figures in history.
            </p>
            <p>
                You might recognize the uniquely New Orleans style of this track from listening to derivative songs in
                movies or theatre, but this is a Pete Fountain original sound. The backbone of the sound is a half-time
                rag in the rhythm section of the band, led up front by a loosey-goosey clarinet lyric. Pete's mastery of
                jazz clarinet shines as an unabashed willingness to bend both pitch and intonation. As a result, his
                sound never bores or settles into a monotonic lyric. Next time you're walking down Bourbon Street, make
                sure to queue this one up and swing like hell.

                Strings | MacLeod's Farewell / Palmer's Gate | The Fretless
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/O5XRJXQlMQk" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live from the Art
                Farm (Video)</a>
            <p>
                To honor the 69th episode, the closing track is taking us into folk territory, so prepare to pucker up
                for your sister after taking a listen.
            </p>
            <p>
                In seriousness though, The Fretless are an extremely talented group of string players who create
                interesting folk music by generating their own rhythm section using only strings, effortlessly fading
                between percussive and lyrical sounds. This style adds a much needed layer of complexity and polyrhythm
                that is typically missing from traditional or imitative folk music. Without overusing one melody in
                particular, the track crafts a weave of sounds drifting over the beat like a cherished friendship over
                time. Just grab a peach tea with a hint of whiskey and enjoy.
