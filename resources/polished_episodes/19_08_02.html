                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm back for week five! Big thanks to Joe for hosting last week; I loved the tracks and I hope all of
                you did too. (If you liked him better than you do me, have no fear - he'll be back! ;) )
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's look at the four lovely tracks landing in your inbox this week.
            </p>

                Bedroom pop — Softly by Clairo
            </h2>
            <p>
                Though not the origin of the genre, Clairo has become its brightest beacon, now with over five-million
                monthly listeners. As far as I know, she's also the only artist to openly mock the genre and its
                expectations in her own lyrics.
            </p>
            <p>
                After her first single, Bags, released in advance of her newest album, my hopes skyrocketed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Immunity, which released this morning, lives up to my expectations. I especially like this track from it
                because, while still calm and whisperingly voiced, it has a romantically uplifting message. If someone
                comes to mind when you hear this, I'm sure that it will resonate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Give it a listen and get in the mood.

                Industrial, upended club banger — Stingray by Ninajirachi and Oh Boy
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ninajirachi is a young, solo DJ from Australia who's turning out some truly unique dance records. With
                around three-hundred-thousand monthly listeners, she's the smallest artist of the week.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy this track primarily because I almost hate it. It's right on the edge of being grimy, yet
                somehow it's just vibrant enough, just engaging enough, and completely fresh enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Get drunk, find a dance floor, and move violently and unpredictably to this.

                Poppy reggae — I Like the Way Your Roll by HIRIE and Slightly Stoopid
            </h2>
            <p>
                I just discovered HIRIE when she announced a concert in Seattle and I have to admit, I'd never heard a
                female front on a reggae sound. I've been missing out!
            </p>
            <p>
                Bringing a genre staple, Slightly Stoopid, to the track sets it squarely in reggae's off-beat tradition
                and the track rolls between rhythmic verse and catchy hook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Catch what's left of the summer sun, and relax to these vibes.

                Airy, indie jazz — nervous by Jonah Yano and BADBADNOTGOOD
            </h2>
            <p>
                This community-track of the week comes from Rachel. Thanks, Rachel!
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd heard of BADBADNOTGOOD before but never dug in. If you liked their flowing 2016 record, IV, you'll
                probably like this May-2019-released collaborative track.
            </p>
            <p>
                This track is intimate, haunting, and soulful. Swinging between images of stimulating cigarettes,
                dizzying wine, and calming tea, Jonah Yano beautifully addresses the object of his affection.
