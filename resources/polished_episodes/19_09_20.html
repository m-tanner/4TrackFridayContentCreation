                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                Joseph and Nate here.
                We're very excited to be guest hosting this week for week 12!
                Big thank you to Michael for letting us host this week and for doing 4TF,
                it's introduced us to some amazing new music we never would have found on our own.
                Like Michael said, this week is going to be hip hop centered with a special surprise at the end
                so be sure to read all the way through!
            </p>

                Breezy hip-hop — Lil Bit by No-uh
            </h2>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5ALZNV7RpE" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">YouTube</a>
            <p>
                At first listen, this track seems relaxed and vivacious.
                However, after repeated listens, our minds were warped by cognitive dissonance for two reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, although No-Uh (pronounced “Noah”) is a native to the Seattle area,
                his music has roots in the boom-bap rap era of the 1990s.
                He blends this old-school style with the refreshing sound from the Pacific Northwest’s up-and-coming rap
                scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, the lyrics evoke either/both a romantic serenade or/and a club party.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of the confusion, it’s great in every circumstance.

                Lyrical rap — The Intro by Jason Price
            </h2>

                If you have been scouring YouTube for the most recent uploads of spoken word competitions to get your
                rhyme fix,
                look no further.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jason Price’s bombastic claim of being the best rapper on Long Island may eventually become a reality.
                This is the perfect opportunity to get in on the ground floor of his witty rhyme schemes and no-frills
                beats.
            </p>

                Bass-boosted, flow-heavy hip-hop - Astronaut In The Ocean by Masked Wolf
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/gXNdCWXO8AM" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">YouTube</a>
            <p>
                Masked Wolf is another artist from Australia that's an up and coming superstar.
                Don't believe us? Just listen to this song and wait for it to blow up.
                This will put him on the map for sure.
            </p>
            <p>
                With around 100,000 monthly listeners, Astronaut In The Ocean recently passed 1 million plays on
                Spotify.
                This guy isn't going to just be a one hit wonder either.
                Check out his song
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0CbFQsm9x76lvevhnitTWY"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Speed Racer</a>
                if you need more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only complaint we have with this song is that it's so short and it just leaves us wanting so much
                more.
                Hopefully you feel the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flow is undeniable,
                the bass is reliable,
                Masked Wolf crushing the game is verifiable,
                falling in love with this song is justifiable so sit back,
                turn up the bass and witness time become pliable as you become hypnotized by Astronaut In The Ocean.

                Poetically ingenious hip-hop - The Basics by Price
            </h2>
            <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/toronto-film-festival-canadas-15-emerging-actors-actresses-1236449/item/canadas-emerging-talent-amybeth-mcnulty-1236465"
               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">In the news</a>
            <p>
                For this one we're turning to our neighbor to the North.
                Not only does Canada give us the best kind of bacon, it also gives us the artist of this brilliant song.
                After you hear this, you might be calling Price the King in the North.
            </p>
            <p>
                Price takes us back to the basics, back to pre-school.
                Yes that's right we're going to learn our ABC's and our 123's
                but this time we're going to do it with the help of some lyrically ingenious hip hop.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is one of the most creative songs we've ever heard. When we first realized what Price was doing,
                we couldn't believe he could take something so fundamental and turn it into something so satisfying.
            </p>

                Celeb song of the week - Fire Song by J.B. Boone
            </h2>
            <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jbboone_music/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Instagram</a>
            <p>
                We're really excited to be hosting this week so we can give a shoutout to our good friend Kevin Boone
                aka J.B. Boone. He's a killer guitarist with an equally mesmerizing voice.
            </p>
            <p>
                He currently has over 8,000 monthly listeners on Spotify with only three songs out. We'd really love to
                feature all three but we'll settle for his most recent one, Fire Song. So seriously, if you enjoy
                Kevin's music, we'd love it if you would share it with your friends!
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing we love most about Kevin's music is how much you can tell he sings from the heart. His passion
                for his music and his lyrics oozes through to the listener and it makes the experience of listening to
                his music that much more enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kevin's music is perfect for the upcoming fall season. So put on some of Kevin's music, crack open an
                IPA (or a Whiteclaw if you can find one), gather your friends around the fire pit, and make some
                memories.
