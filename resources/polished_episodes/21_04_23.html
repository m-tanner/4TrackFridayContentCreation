                Hello friends,
            </p>
<p>
                This week was tough because I've been listening to so many previously shared artists lately.
                TSHA, and Litany, and Sumner have been on straight repeat! It was good to be forced out of that
                safe groove to selects songs for this week, though.
            </p>
<p>
                Up first we've got a track that dropped my jaw when it came out two weeks ago, a dazzlingly smooth electronica track from the 90's,
                and two other tracks that I hope you'll find quite interesting. Let's get into 'em.
            </p>

                Synth Dance | Ego | Beso Palma, RISSA
            </h2>
<p>
                As soon as this track came on, I was bopping around.
            </p>
<p>
                You've got everything you need for a soulful dance track here. The bass synth sounds like
                its keys are being danced upon, and hard. It's got "that wavy sound" that I can never get enough of.
                And with RISSA's smooth and sassy vocals! Seriously, what else could you ask for?
            </p>
<p>
                Sit still, I dare you.

                Electronica | Collage of Dreams | John Beltran
            </h2>
<p>
                fabric nightclub released their rebooted "presents" series in 2019, with the legendary Bonobo kicking it off.
                I remember when it came out how torn Joe and I were about it. It was so different than what we'd normally expect
                from Simon Green and we couldn't decide if we liked it. Well, we definitely liked the first half, but
                the second was notably less... comfortable.
            </p>
<p>
                However, this is the track that closes that album and I've come to adore it. From this classic, Lansing-based
                producer, John Beltran, comes a track that shines most in its smallest moments. There's a deep, driving force, but the track effortlessly allows much
                more subtle elements to float around within it. And those are its best bits.
            </p>
<p>
                You have to get pretty still for to sink into this one, but if you do, I think you'll find yourself handsomely rewarded.

                Indie Folk | The Night | Little Green
            </h2>
<p>
                After opening up and shuffling one of my "these would be good to send out" playlists, this one
                really got my attention. Amy Nelson is a Sydney based singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer
                and she's got quite the mellow and uplifting sound.
            </p>
<p>
                The combination of her silky voice and light flute with her calming production style result in some
                evocative tunes perfect for sunrises and sunsets days alike. Catch the pink rays to this one.

                Ultraviolet | Before Midnight Tonight | Hugo Kant
            </h2>
<p>
                Tamas shared this album with me months ago, but I returned to it this week. Throughout the album,
                this multi-instrumentalist from France assembles stunningly arranged tracks. He's able
                to juxtapose wubbing bass against sharp flute and plucked guitar in a way I really like.
                Kant even uses segments of a JFK speech to highlight a message of yearning
                for collaboration within a track that otherwise seems quite disparate and minimal.
            </p>
<p>
                And perhaps that's the point, if these seemingly dissimilar musical elements can come together to reach
                a common purpose, why can't the world?
            </p>
