                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                It's been a while since I sent one of these out late in the day! I did add the songs to the playlists
                this morning, though. You're welcome, DJ.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots of wonderful music has been releasing lately and many of you have been sending me wonderful tracks.
                They will be on episodes soon! Just today, three tracks released that I already love, including one that
                Mike Wang and I were lucky enough to hear first at Télépopmusik's live show last night.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today we've got music from a French duo, two smaller acts from Australia and New Zealand (I'm not biased
                I swear), and a German.
                Sorry, America.
            </p>

                Downtempo electronica | Opale by il:lo
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/DZM-VvOuxvc" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live set</a>
            <p>
                Picking one track to send from il:lo was excruciating. Remember when I made Joe chose one song to
                represent all of Bonobo? I didn't feel the pain then because I wasn't the one doing it, but I did this
                time.
                I've selected this track to introduce you to il:lo, the French duo from whom you'll hear soon in Four
                Track's
                second-ever interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                After meeting in Prague, this duo has been collaborating since 2012. Most of their music can be
                considered
                downtempo, but it comes across with a strong organic energy. The weighty bass lines
                lay a foundation for floating brass, flutes, and other dazzling melodies that Dejan Dejado and Andreas
                Schuetz
                position atop them.
            </p>
            <p>
                If this one is up your alley, you're in luck as it's off one of several EP's. These are all
                in addition to their first full length album, which released at the end of last year. As an
                extra-special treat,
                the Four Track veteran, Frameworks, released
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2QuOKdeZG0UgtDxTPZPZU5"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">a remix</a>
                of il:lo's <i>Alma</i> today and it's the perfect combination of the sounds from

                Indie pop | Glitter by BENEE
            </h2>

            <p>
                I recently got an ad on Facebook for a newly scheduled show at Neptune Theater. Seeing it I thought
                to myself, "Wait, I know BENEE..." After playing just a few tracks on Spotify I had no choice
                but to buy a ticket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stella Bennett got her start by posting covers to SoundCloud before making her own music in her final
                year of high school.
                She tried college for two weeks, but decided to go into music professionally instead.
                Now she's got loads of tracks with tens of millions of streams with no signs of slowing down. After all,
                she
                only turned twenty years old about a month ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hidden gem of Bennett's 2019 album, <i>Glitter</i> weaves an infectious energy into easy vibes.
                Soothing hooks form an invitation to get intimate even when it makes us feel anxious. Turn the party
                into your own scene with this one and get clumpy.

                Indie rock | Trouble by Ruby Fields

                Ruby Phillip's bio is two words, "Average chick."
            </p>
            <p>
                Far from it, Phillips is making some kick ass rock music. Hailing from southern Sydney, she had her
                breakout
                year in 2018 when her single <i>Dinosaurs</i> hit number nine on
                <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/18/countdown/1-100/"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">triple j's Hottest 100</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her music comes across incredibly raw. On this one, even her stridency contains loads of vulnerability.
                Singing about the absolute pain that is modern dating, Ruby makes you feel like you're reading her
                diary,
                but delivered as punk rock. If you find yourself to somehow be too much trouble for the modern scene,
                take refuge in Ruby's ode to independence.

                Deutsch rock | Avicii by Thees Uhlmann

            <p>
                Okay. This song gets me all emotional. I'm not sure how he found it, but Scott sent this to me
                a few weeks ago and it absolutely broke my heart.
                If you know me, you know that I hold Avicii and his music close to my heart. Apparently Thees Uhlmann,
                the musician and author from northern Germany, does too.
            </p>
            <p>
                This track is an homage to Tim Berling, the man behind one of electronic music's greatest all time acts.
                Like Uhlmann sings, it's rare that electronic music can be as beautiful and meaningful as when Avicii
                made it.
                It's wonderful to see one genre so powerfully remember another and the combination is one that I
                hope you enjoy as much as I do.
            </p>
            <p>
