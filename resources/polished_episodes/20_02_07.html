                Hey Everyone,
            </p>
            <p>
                This week we have two songs that have come out within the previous week, some very well-known artists,
                and some not. As an extra-special treat, you'll find a truly extraordinary YouTube mix rounding out the
                week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since next week's Four Track will come out exactly on Valentine's day, I'm going to theme the episode
                around love. Let me know in an email or text what you'd prefer: rosy or bleak ðŸ™ƒ
            </p>
            <p>
                As a final PSA, a few of us are going to a
                <a href="https://www.nectarlounge.com/e/little-people-frameworks-yppah-75966916091/"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">concert tonight at Nectar Lounge</a>.
                I have an extra ticket that Brittany has offered to donate to the first taker. So if you're interested
                in vibing out to some
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livetronica" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">livetronica</a>
                tonight, hit me up.

                Eclectic pop - Cinnamon by Hayley Williams
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/6MtMSbOqBME" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">In the Live
                Lounge</a>
            <p>
                To kick this episode off, we have a song from my favorite project happening this year.
                Hayley Williams, with whom you're already familiar as the lead singer from Paramore, has
                kicked off her own
                <a href="https://www.petalsforarmor.com/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">solo
                    project</a>
                called <i>Petals For Armor</i>.
                Yesterday she released the
                <a href="https://hayleywilliams.lnk.to/PetalsForArmorIWE"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">first part</a>
                of an album that will fully release later this year.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mini-album is best enjoyed in its entirety and in tandem with William's recent and very personal
                <a href="https://youtu.be/gTuq6_bqUEk" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">interview
                    with Zane Lowe</a>.
                The interview is simultaneously emotional, scary, and heartwarming.
            </p>
            <p>
                This track, <i>Cinnamon</i>, is the first track from the project that wasn't released as a single,
                like the rage-filled <i>Simmer</i> and loss-considering <i>Leave It Alone</i> were. Like the others,
                the track is funky, impossibly well-produced, and features incredibly enjoyable and funky drumming.
            </p>
            <p>
                After releasing one of my favorite Paramore albums, <i>After Laughter</i>, and now this,
                I hope she never stops making music!

                Electro pop - Blinded by Mint Julep
            </h2>
            <p>
                After a lot of recent travelling, I was drained and looking for some healing music. This sent me back
                into the archives of post rock, modern classical, and more. On this journey, I re-discovered
                some of my all-time favorites, one of which was a piece from Goldmund's Keith Kenniff. I then remembered
                that Keith had another project, called Helios. And then I discovered that Keith had started yet another
                project with his wife, Hollie, which had just released a new album!
            </p>
            <p>
                "The project really just started out as a way to get my wife to sing, because I knew that she could
                but was kind of shy about it," says Keith. "It's been great for Hollie and me to
                bond over making music, and to have that music feed into our relationship... Writing music
                can be stressful, but there's that joy that comes from creating something that you know you'll have for
                a really long time.
                We can finish an album and move on, and then go back years later and let the songs tell us what was
                happening then,
                what we were feeling."
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the track that kicks off that wonderfully light and poppy album, which is reminiscent of
                CHVRCHES and
                Metric. This album is quite different from their earlier work, which showed much more influence of
                shoegaze. The combination of synths, edgy guitar, and live drums that they now channel is
                quite refreshing.

                Alt electronic - Blame Myself by Sumner
            </h2>
            <p>
                It's been a minute since a shared a proper banger. Sometimes I can get a bit
                shy about the simplicity of this genre, but this one from
                the Tasmanian duo, Chloe Wilson and Jack McLaine, quieted any concerns.
                The detailed production and honest lyrics have combined to become what one critic
                called "an almighty bop."
            </p>
            <p>
                Releasing their first tracks in 2018 before this one last year, the duo has begun
                supporting better known Australian acts on tours and playing smaller music festivals.
                If they keep it up, it won't be long before they are lighting up nightclubs on their own
                all around the world.

                Rock - In the Fade by Queens of the Stone Age
            </h2>
            <p>
                This blast from the past made me realize that I really haven't listened to
                anything from Queens of the Stone Age earlier than 2002. Earlier this week I
                got a bit excited about how my new
                <a href="https://www.headphones.com/pages/what-is-a-dac"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">DAC/amp</a>
                made drums sound and asked Travis for some tracks with really good percussion. He sent me back a whole
                playlist's worth
                of songs (from which you'll hear another soon).
            </p>
            <p>
                QOTSA put out their first album in 1998, which influenced music in ways
                similar to Nirvana, The Strokes, and the Foo Fighters. In fact, David Grohl
                put the Foo Fighters on pause (after his time with Nirvana) to drum for
                QOTSA and Julian Casablancas contributed to Era Vulgaris.
            </p>
            <p>
                This track is a great example of garage-rock's sound in the early 2000's.
                It has the drums, which are as good as Travis suggested, the several slightly distorted guitars,
                and the slightly raspy vocals. Go back to younger days and give this one a listen.

            </h2>
            <p>
                To finish off this week, I'd like to share a mix that Tenzin sent me.
                Most of these songs aren't on streaming services, but you can click the link above to
                listen on YouTube.

            <p>
                It's an absolutely non-stop vibe. Leading off with the best track that's ever been related to DJ Hanzel,
                which is the joke side project of better-known Dillon Francis, the mix starts off strong
                and really never reduces its energy.
            </p>

                He went one more deeper. And I liked it.
