<p>
                Hey everyone,
            </p>
<p>
                Thank you, Lily, for hosting last week!
            </p>
<p>
                Four short weeks ago, Ryan told me, "the album is dead."
                Well, almost accidentally I've produced an episode to prove him wrong.
                With songs from Gabriela, Joe, and Doug supporting the effort, every track this week comes from
                an album best heard in its entirety. I've <i>attempted</i> the impossible task of
                picking a representative and enticing track from each, but we all know that everyone will have
                a different favorite!
            </p>
<p>
                Let me know how you like them ðŸ˜„
            </p>

                Yacht Rock | Flammable | Whitehall
            </h2>
<p>
                When Gabriela sent me Whitehall's "Vacation Home," I immediately fell in love with this
                Charleston, SC-based four-piece. After discovering it was just the opener of their 2018 record, <i>Ocean Fiction</i>,
                I listened to nothing else for a couple days.
            </p>
<p>
                The album kicks off with a distinct "wanting more" vibe, including wishing you weren't everyone's side piece, seeking to spice up your current situation, and wanting to "hyperfocus on what's at stake."
                From there it veers into its most deeply lyrical efforts, with "I'm Clean" even referencing the well-depicted self-doubt of Macbeth.
                Slowing itself down, the album then hits Gabriela's favorite, "Fading,"
                which is unique for its sad arrangement actually matching the sorrow lyrics.
                Finally, before the album signs off with its most instrumental track, it picks up the pace
                once more on "Left Behind," which bookends the album's lyrical themes well.
            </p>
<p>
                The record's biggest strength, though, is the way the instrumentation strengthens the story. In fact,
                Pat Magwood (saxophone) and Avery Greeson (guitar) seem to sing as meaningfully Paddy Mckiernan does vocally.
                Add in the impeccable anchors that are Brennan Clark (bass) and Davis Rowe (drums), and you have a band that isn't missing anything.
            </p>
<p>
                Iman Qatawi remarked, "The band does not have a weak member, and somehow they all manage to stand out without ever outshining one another"
                and I couldn't agree more. The energy comes across high, yet balanced, and is an energizing joy to listen to.
            </p>
<p>
                Even though Magwood is no longer with the band, they're planning to release a bunch of music this year
                and I hope you look forward to it as much as I do.
            </p>

                Electro Soul | Say Yes | Gibbz
            </h2>
<p>
                In search of more "slinky vibes" (as Rachel put it in
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_07_31.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">one</a> of her episodes),
                one of Joe's past recommendations came to mind, namely Gibbz's <i>These Are Love Songs</i> (though notably not all uplifting).
                "Say Yes" has all of the summer vibes I'm looking for as spring lifts my spirits.
            </p>
<p>
                Mike Gibney has made a name for himself with his easygoing and sensual stage performances. Even though
                I've never had the pleasure of seeing him for myself, he seems to have
                bottled that up perfectly on this album. Without neglecting love's downs (on tracks like "Not the One"), Gibney effortlessly
                makes the argument that the highs are worth it. I think you'll find the entire record rather compelling.
            </p>

                60's Pop | Safe In L.A. | Gold Motel
            </h2>
<p>
                Here to take us from slinky to purely sunny is Gretta Morgan's big-band-feeling pop group, Gold Motel.
                A recent rediscovery for me, <i>Summer House</i> has been a delight as the sun begins to show itself more often.
                In order to pick a single track, I've simply selected the track that originally hooked <i>me</i> on Gold Motel,
                the lovely "Safe In L.A."
            </p>
<p>
                Morgan's singing, supported by Dan Duszynski, Matt Minx, Adam Coldhouse's guitars and room-filling drums,
                makes me feel like I should be in a linen suit on Governor's Island dancing the day away.
                Combine that with its heart-warming optimism in the face of a new relationship
                and you have something that's easy to enjoy.
            </p>
<p>
                You'll find that there's plenty more where this came from, as the whole of
                <i>Summer House</i> examines the highs and lows of love and single life.
                From "Perfect (In My Mind)" to "The Cruel One" and "Who Will I Be Tonight?" Morgan never fails
                to connect with the listener and I hope she evokes some feelings for you.
            </p>

                Avicii-esque | Big Hearted | Vargas &amp; Lagola
            </h2>
<p>
                To round out the week we have a track that Doug recommended to me earlier this year.
                You've likely heard the sound of this duo before, since they were collaborators with Avicii.
                In fact, after working with EDM's greatest producer on "Friend Of Mine"
                they were summoned to help finish a few Tim's posthumous tracks: "Peace of Mind," "Tough Love," and "Excuse Me Mr Sir."
            </p>
<p>
                However, they stand well on their own, and particularly so on their 2021 <i>Mount Alda</i>. Gently
                alternating between upper and downer for the entire length of the 11 track record, it's a wonderful listening experience.
            </p>
<p>
                This track, though, is the best suited for some sunshine and I think it'll perfectly
                stoke your optimism for the changing seasons.
            </p>
