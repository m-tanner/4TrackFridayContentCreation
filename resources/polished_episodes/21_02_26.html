                Hey everyone,
            </p>
<p>
                As many of you know, Daft Punk have parted ways after 28 years together.
            </p>

<i>Discovery</i> is the first album I can remember falling in love with and re-listening to it
                this week has been a much-welcomed dose of nostalgia.
                From it comes what I still believe to be the most "perfect" song I've ever heard:
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/FxzBvqY5PP0" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">Digital Love</a>."
                Like so many others have remarked this week, I'll be forever grateful for this unforgettable French duo.
            </p>
<p>
                Avoiding bringing us down too much, though, it's worth pointing out that
                Daft Punk has been reborn for a new generation in the still-French L'Impératrice.
                In fact, their
                <a href="https://youtu.be/VUH-z_SBlj0" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">newest music video</a>
                takes heavy inspiration from the robots'
                <a href="https://youtu.be/LKYPYj2XX80" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">video</a> for "Around the World."
                and it makes me quite excited for the release of their forthcoming album, <i>TAKO TSUBO</i>.
            </p>
<p>
                With that, let's get into this week.

                Alt Gone Soft | Turn The Light | Karen O (feat. Danger Mouse)
            </h2>
<p>
                After my recent Metric and CHVRCHΞS binge, I found myself returning to the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' classic albums.
                This reminded me that Karen O had ventured out on her own, but I realized that I hadn't yet dedicated the hours
                to exploring her album, <i>Lux Prima</i>.
            </p>
<p>
                With the help of Danger Mouse, she's produced and album that's deeply groovy, even catchy at times,
                but which is always subdued. While Karen O's vocals for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were always spectacular,
                she somehow finds a way to shine brighter while alone on these tracks, perhaps due to the the more minimalist instrumentation.
                While you'll find her almost screaming on <i>It's Blitz!</i>, <i>Lux</i> let's her whisper a little more:
                like she's with you in her bedroom rather than rocking a stage.
            </p>
<p>
                It's great to see her branch out and I am glad we get to hear both sides of her.
            </p>

                Rock Candy | Honolulu | Last Dinosaurs
            </h2>
<p>
                A four-piece from Brisbane, this group of high school friends is named after a song by The Pillows, of all things.
                However, they embrace the dino theme on <i>In A Million Years</i>,
                which I think you'll agree doesn't have a bad song on it.
            </p>
<p>
                "Honolulu" happens to be my favorite track from the record, almost entirely due to its guitar-only intro.
                The style in which it's played, the echo from each string that perfectly places you in the room, and
                the way it rapidly blooms into what becomes the rest of the track is eyes-closed-smile-inducing stuff.
            </p>
<p>
                There's a reason this album made it to the #8 spot on the Australian Albums Chart when it debuted in 2012
                and it sounds just as good today.

                Poetry | Woozy With Cider | James Yorkston (feat. Jon Hopkins)
            </h2>
<p>
                Shawn sent me this and, though it was just outside of my musical comfort zone, it hit me in my poetry place.
            </p>
<p>
                Best experienced while
                <a href="https://genius.com/James-yorkston-woozy-with-cider-lyrics" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">reading along</a>,
                James Yorkston delivers a poem in his beautiful Scottish voice, softly depicting the ups and downs
                of life and the uncertainty that comes existing in this world.
                His cadence, complemented with Jon Hopkins' production, is my favorite feature.
                That and the way in which Yorkston says so much with such small, well-crafted phrases.
                The track brings up lots of thoughts and emotions for me, but I think the song speaks best for itself.
                See what it says to you.

                Ping Pong Gone Song | Bubbles | Yosi Horikawa
            </h2>
<p>
                Yesterday, Doug put this track on to test out my sound system and I was blown away.
                Saying he found it on a Spotify playlist for "testing the sound stage of headphones,"
                I expected it to be interesting, but not <i>this</i> interesting.
            </p>
<p>
                Yosi Horikawa has somehow perfectly fit the sound of bouncing balls
                into a masterpiece that would fit shockingly well in a deep house club atmosphere.
                Like the previously shared KOAN Sound,
                Horikawa has created perfectly melded the natural and unnatural and I hope
                you enjoy the headiness.
