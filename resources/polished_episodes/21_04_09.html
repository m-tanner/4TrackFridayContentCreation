<p>
                Hello friends,
            </p>
<p>
                I'm stoked to bring you three songs this week that
                released <i>last week</i>. I finally feel on top of
                my game again! Now if I could only schedule in more time
                to write...
            </p>
<p>
                Speaking of writing, 4 Track Friday's 100<sup>th</sup> episode
                is quickly approaching! I'm not sure what kind of special
                episode would be most exciting, so let me know if you have
                any thoughts! Something I've played with for a while is the
                idea of a "redo" week, where I select a second track from
                four artists already shared. Which artists do you think have
                a second track that is a must share?
            </p>
<p>
                I also have a podcast episode that Joe and I recorded.
                I just need to edit it.
                Please text me and pressure me to do that...
            </p>
<p>
                To the tracks!
            </p>

                Deep Industrial Experimental Drum'n'Bass | Arms | Luude
            </h2>
<p>
                Luude is an Australian electronic music producer
                who, I think, has mastered the anti-drop.
            </p>
<p>
                He layers speedy percussion, blissful vocal samples, and deep, deep
                synths perfectly as he builds to the drop, which sinks you into
                the sound of futuristic levitating cars drifting in a night race around Tokyo.
            </p>
<p>
                The sound design alone has kept me playing this one over and over all week.

                Laidback Hip Hop | Murda | Gamirez, Alutondo
            </h2>
<p>
                Now it's time to talk about a song that's been slowing me down in the best of ways.
                The swinging, reggae-ish beat sets the stage for Gamirez's
                confident and intoxicating bars.
            </p>
<p>
                I can't think of a better track to swing your hips to this summer.

                Crush Pop | i wanted to call her but i'm tragic and she's overseas (8 months) | Lola Scott, Mel Blue
            </h2>
<p>
                Citing Broods as an influence, it's not hard to see why I'm in love with Lola Scott this week.
                She describes her own sound as "synth-heavy indie pop floating in melancholic drama" and
                I definitely couldn't have thought of a better way to put it.
            </p>
<p>
                Releasing last Friday, this track is effortlessly low key, crushingly relatable, and
                refreshingly catchy. Lola Scott certainly has a bright future ahead of her in Sydney.
            </p>

                Jazz Funk | Beastly (Live at Madison Square Garden) | Vulfpeck
            </h2>
<a href="https://youtu.be/rv4wf7bzfFE" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Full Live Performance</a>
<p>
                Spencer sent me this live album earlier this week and it's been rocking my world.
                The funk group's core members met at University of Michigan's music school and
                are Jack Stratton (keys, drums, guitar), Theo Katzman (guitar, percussion, vocals), Woody Goss (keys), and Joe Dart (bass).
                Many more members are part of the touring act, as you can hear here.
            </p>
<p>
                As always, it was difficult to pick a single track to share from this album.
                Each track is more or less a solo for a different artist!
                However, this one features my favorite of the crew, Joe Dart, while
                being well accompanied.
            </p>
<p>
                Notably, this is also the first track the group ever released, so
                it's fitting if it's the first one you've ever heard from them.
                But I doubt you've made it this far without hearing their
                catchy "Back Pocket!"
            </p>
