                Hello friends,
            </p>
<p>
                The past couple weeks, I've aimed to listen to a bit more rock and get a couple heavier guitar tracks on the playlist.
                This week, I'm happy to say that I've found two that delight me in the way that only indignant, long-haired garage dwellers seem
                to be able to. Excitingly, one of the tracks even released this morning!
            </p>
<p>
                To go along with the harder stuff, we've got some of the most intelligent drumming and quirkiest production you'll hear this year.
            </p>

                Punk Rock | Bus | Pandamic
            </h2>
<p>
                "I hope you get hit by a fucking bus / Then it runs you over in reverse," sings front-man Rhys Adams
                on this deliciously angry punk track. Yet the magic of this one is that, despite its vitriol,
                you're more likely to find yourself smiling and nodding along rather than getting amped up.
            </p>
<p>
                The hatred is so complete and overdone that it becomes slightly comedic and definitely cathartic.

                Math Jazz | This Is My Swamp | Shrek Is Love
            </h2>
<p>
                Maybe you'll have seen the YouTube video, "Shrek Is Love." I hadn't, but clearly this band has. The four piece
                only released two three-track EP's, but I'm glad they did and I'm glad Spencer showed me this track.
            </p>
<p>
                Their music combines R&amp;B, jazz, soul, and even elements of vaporwave on some tracks. On this track specifically,
                I can't get enough of the raw intelligence they display. The interplay between the dancing keys, perfectly pocketed drums, and snappy
                bass is oh so satisfying. Top it off with the meme vocals and the playfulness can't help but brighten your day.
            </p>

                Alt Rock | Plagiarise | Coldwave
            </h2>
<p>
                Out this morning, "Plagiarise" is the newest track from this Adelaide five-piece. It's only the second track
                for them, but they're quickly making a name for themselves in Australia's post-punk scene.
            </p>
<p>
                It's a great mix of enjoyable melody, noise wall, and vocals that cut through it all.
                In the spirit of the track, I'll copy and paste (but quote...) triple j's Dave Ruby Howe, "Coldwave write like they've got ice in their veins but play like the rehearsal studio's on fire."

                Quirk | Passing Through | Balthazar
            </h2>
<p>
                Joe had to remind me a couple times to listen to Balthazar's recently released <i>Sand</i>, but when
                I finally got around to it I was blown away.
            </p>
<p>
                A 10/10 album, it's one of the quirkiest I think I've ever found. And as you all know, when you find
                an album that's great <i>as an album</i>, it's difficult to pick a single track to share!
                After some back and forth, Joe and I have settled on "Passing Through," though.
            </p>
<p>
                Playfully written and entertainingly produced, it features well layered vocals, strings that come from out of nowhere, and the
                ominously speedy synths that seem straight out of a Stanley Kubrick film.
                You'll either love this or hate this, but I love it.
