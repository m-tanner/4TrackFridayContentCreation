                Hey everyone,
            </p>
            <p>
                It is the most COMPLEX week of the year. Are you single? Dating someone? Longing for someone? Maybe you straight up don’t give a fuck (same).
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways, happy valentines day.
            </p>

                Cars play a significant role in indexing the “progression” of a relationship. The anxious wait for them to get to your house for the first time. The brief, meaningless drives to pick up food when you’re both bored but still feel like being around eachother. The drive back home after a messy break up.
            </p>
            <p>
                The songs presented below put us on that timeline. Let’s dig in.

                It’s drunk texting. It’s late night hookups. It gives me a feeling of infatuation. I want to be around you and I want to stay the night with you. There’s a feeling captured by this song that’s reminiscent of the thrill of the first time driving over and feeling like ugh, yes. Theyre into me and I didn’t ever expect it could get this far.
            </p>
            <p>
                This feels like the thrill of the chase at the start of a new spark.

                GENRE | Do U Thing Abt Me?? | Glitch Gum
            </h2>
            <p>
                GET<br/>
                FUCKING<br/>

                Now we’re together. It’s the obsessive-esque feeling that accommodates the crush phase, while  not knowing someone else’s status in the “situation” like: Are you thinking about me?? Do you like me as much as I like you?? I feel like my mind is wandering towards you every time I’m stuck in traffic.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Do you think about me in your back seat, thinking of all the things that you would talk about with me?”
            </p>
            <p>
                The song ends in a way where the person singing about their infatuation is starting to resent this feeling within them. It gets so loud and uncomfortable. It’s so well intentioned but so intense at the same time that they don’t know how to properly express it except a full lash-out.

                We’re driving somewhere together. This used to feel better. Why did it feel so much better?
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s this unsteady tension and a longing for the original rush of something new. We’ve tried so hard and we’ve worked through every problem. We did it all the way they said we should have been doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s really one of those drives where you’re sitting less than a foot from the person you love, and you’re like….. Damn. It’s really time we called it.

                Every time I see the make and model of your car, I kind of wonder is that you? Are our lives intersecting again?
            </p>
            <p>
                When I got dumped was going through a breakup I couldn’t help but look at all the cars driving by and hope they were in it. Just so we could see eachother again and benchmark one more moment where we’re in eachothers lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh nevermind. It doesn’t have the dent I remember your car having lol. What a weirdo.
