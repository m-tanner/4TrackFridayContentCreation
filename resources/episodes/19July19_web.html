                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the third week! If this is your first, I’m glad you've joined! We’re a group of 27 now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realized I forgot to cite Dan, who sent me last week’s featured track. This week’s comes from Joe, who will coincidentally be hosting this email seven days from now while I’m on silent retreat. Say hi!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have some pretty great, very unique tracks for you this week. Finding genres to claim for the songs this week was almost impossible! If you listen to one of these and can name its genre, please email me.
            </p>

                Electro-punk — Death of Me by PVRIS
            </h2>
            <p>
                PVRIS is my favorite discovery of 2018. From their first acoustic LP in 2014 to their full-length albums of 2016 and ’17, their music is delightfully difficult to define. However, what’s constant is its heartfelt and raw nature. Lynn Gunn brings an insightful mind to everything she sings about, from the personal to the spiritual. It’s easy to feel in each of her productions as though she’s letting you in on something, past or present.
            </p>
            <p>
                The lyrics deal with something that you’ve perhaps experienced: a love for which you’ll tear your life apart. Give it a listen and let me know if you can relate.

                Summer hip-hop — Suburbia by Order Sixty6
            </h2>
            <p>
                What a bold name for a rap group! (If you don’t get the reference, you have a lot of movies to watch.)
            </p>
            <p>
                As a group of four guys based out of Brisbane, each of these guys clearly knows what it's like to feel the need to prove yourself. And, on this recently released single, I think they do just that. Each time I listen to it, I enjoy how much the wordplay emphasizes its punch lines. Top it all with a bouncy xylophone and you have a song that’s easy to pop on repeat. If they make it big, know that you were one of their first 1,000 listeners.

                Busking gone pop — Never Seen the Rain by Tones and I
            </h2>
            <p>
                Tones and I is absolutely blowing up the Australian music scene lately. With this as her third (!) release, she already has well over 2 million monthly listeners. Just like someone you’ve already met, Fergus James, she played Splendour this weekend. Who wants to fly out to that festival with me next year?
            </p>
            <p>
                As her most anthemic pop song, this is catchy. Put it on in the car and feel the commute melt away.

                Folktronica — Linger Longer by Cosmo Sheldrake
            </h2>
            <p>
                This track comes from you guys, and it’s my personal taste-breaker for the week.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had to ask Google to help me define the genre of this one, and it gave me “folktronica,” so, yes, that’s a real thing! This track gets me out of my comfort zone, but keeps me interested all the while. The arrangement sounds like a symphony, but it’s got lyrics and drums, too. It really keeps me on my toes and I sink into it more and more with each listen. Joe described Cosmo as “quirky, expressive and theatrical” and I think he’s absolutely right.
