                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                It's week 19. I have a little more time. Let's see if I can write something proper today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fergus James, San Mei, Vin Bogart, Jack Botts, Jason Price,
                PVRIS, Above & Beyond, Japanese Wallpaper, and Snarky Puppy have all come out with new tracks since
                you discovered them here on earlier editions. How do I keep up with all this? I don't know either.
            </p>
            <p>
                This week I've got mostly electronic songs for you. Let's get to 'em.

                Electro-pop - M.I.A. by MARSHES
            </h2>
            <p>
                MARSHES is my find of the week, no doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is her first single EVER, after performing shows this past
                year all around Australia. About writing the song,
                she says, "I wrote M.I.A. at a time when my friends were calling
                me a lot but I wouldn't answer. It was disappointing to them
                because I needed time to myself, but I never communicated that
                to them. I just disappeared."
            </p>
            <p>
                I know we all have plans for ourselves. Enjoy the
                attitude and style that MARSHES brings to that experience.
            </p>

                Electronica - Lost Inside by Jeremy Blake
            </h2>
            <p>
                Joe B. first showed me Jeremy back in 2017, but by a different name,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Red Means Recording</a>.
                In
                <a href="https://youtu.be/7z4hoazra_g" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">these YouTube videos</a>
                , you can watch Jeremy build entire songs in front of you with
                lots of humor sprinkled atop.
            </p>
            <p>
                I particularly enjoy this track's meandering melody and
                you can find it, along with the rest of the album, performed live
                <a href="https://youtu.be/lgSwS969yDI" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.

                Punk - Somewhere Else by Introvert
            </h2>
            <p>
                This track just is fresh out of Newcastle, Australia and it has an edge to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reminiscent of past acts like Nirvana, The Offspring, and Blink-182, this group
                drives its simple lyrics forward with heavy guitars.
            </p>
            <p>
                With their infectious sound, they are likely to blow up in the alternative scene pretty soon.
                Stay on the lookout.

                Dance - Just Dancing by Sylvan Esso
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm late to the party on this one, but Sylvan Esso is incredible.
                This came on while Rachel and I were climbing at Seattle Bouldering Project and
                she thought I was crazy when I ran up to the front desk to ask what song was playing.
                "It's Just Dancing by Sylvan Esso, duh."
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, this one gets me movin' every time. The song divides into
                two distinct phases and the transition into the song's second half is so exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was also surprised to find that the rest of this album is rather eclectic.
                If you like the pair's sound here, I encourage you to give the whole EP a listen. Maybe you'll
                find your new favorite song.
