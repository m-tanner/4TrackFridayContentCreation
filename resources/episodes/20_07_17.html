                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                This week I have some pretty laid back, smooth music for you. I've been enjoying it while working and
                studying. In the coming weeks, I want to head in a more acoustic direction, so please send things my
                way if that makes you think of anything. A few of you already have!
            </p>
            <p>
                Oh, and don't forget to check out

                Dark pop | Still Here by Kllo
            </h2>
            <a href="https://ghostly.com/products/maybe-we-could"
               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Interview and background</a>
            <p>
                This track comes from <i>Maybe We Could,</i> the newest album from Melbourne cousins Chloe Kaul and
                Simon Lam, known as Kllo (pronounced to rhyme with "flow"). This duo and their attitude towards music really intrigues me.
            </p>
            <p>
                They began releasing music together in 2016, but after a couple years took a break after feeling out
                of sync. This allowed them to each explore separately, Kaul heading to Los Angeles and Lam travelling
                to no one place. After this hiatus, they've come back together and produced this album.
            </p>
            <blockquote>"We’re a bit older now. We aren’t compromising as much on this album. It's a little bit classier and more tasteful this time around."</blockquote>
            <p>
                <i>Maybe We Could</i> does, indeed, come across as a more refined and understated effort than <i>Backwater.</i>
                And while the vocals take a bit of a back seat in this track, they are more than highlighted in other other
                ones, where Kaul's vulnerability really shines through. However, this is the track I keep coming back to listen
                to over and over and wanted to share with you. If this is your mood right now, be sure to try out their
                other tracks.

                Deep lounge | No Time by Lastlings

                The second family pair on this list, I was recently excited to discover the duo Amy and Josh Dowdle
                via Kllo's Spotify page. The Japanese-Australian siblings have been dedicated to making music for six
                years and it recently paid off, as RÜFÜS DU SOL's record label, Rose Avenue Records, signed them. In fact,
                this track is the latest single to be released in advance of their upcoming debut album with this new label.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything about this track is sharp, neatly cut, and well arranged. The kick drum borders on piercing.
                The synth and its echos decay rapidly. The guitar is plucked and quickly deadened. The break into the refrain
                is clear and satisfying. And this is where Amy's voice really launches the track into a dancy vibe.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's clearly electronic and perfect for those lounge nights when you want <i>to want</i> to go dancing, but
                feel more at ease with a gin and tonic on a couch.

                Disco hip-hop | Forever by Bread Club, Phil Fresh
            </h2>
            <p>
                I mean, these guys know how to have a good time. This track was worth sharing for its album artwork
                alone. And how could I not share a group that's named for their shared love of bread.
            </p>
            <p>
                I think those of you that dig

                will really like this. It's similarly polished and easy on the ears,
                but with more hip-hop than indie, which is brought to you by the Sydney-based Phil Fresh.
            </p>
            <p>
                Delivering lines that make you smile or laugh, especially with the whispering at the end,
                you're sure to enjoy this one.

                French indie | City of Light by Palatine
            </h2>
            <p>
                When briefly discussing her disappointment in Bombay Bicycle Club's newest work, Michaeleen recommended I
                listen to a different album she'd recently discovered instead. <i>Grand paon de nuit</i> ("Big night peacock," according to Google translate)
                was the album, which is half English, half French. "It's like a French alt-J," she said.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is, obviously, one of the English tracks, but I enjoy the French ones just as much. The group has
                an uncanny ability to pull you into their mood. In a shockingly powerful way,
                these tracks will suck you in, slow you down, and offer you a chance to catch a break in what otherwise
                might be a busy day.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take some time to pause with this one.
