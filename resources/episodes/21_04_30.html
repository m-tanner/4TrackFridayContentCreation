                Hello friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                I've accidentally written an episode full of songs that would be just as fitting for a
                Valentine's Day episode. But to those of you that will undoubtedly ask, no I'm not seeing anyone
                new or in love. It's just where this week of music took me ðŸ˜‰
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, three of this week's four come from community submissions. Maybe <i>they're</i> in love.
            </p>

            </h2>
            <p>
                This track has been on my radar and in my headphones since it came out April 9th and continues
                the thread of Australian pop that I've been into and recently sharing (Lola Scott and Beso Palma).
            </p>
            <p>
                The lyrics are simple and catchy. The vocal performance is undeniably sweet, surrounded by a
                poppy, but not shiny, production. The lack of sparkle is a positive to me, allowing the track to
                feel a little more real. (The most overdone sparkle I can remember enjoying is Ariana Grande's "Be Alright.")

            </h2>
            <p>
                In interviews, Hayley Williams has described her inability to write love songs. On her newest album,
                <i>FLOWERS for VASES / descansos</i>, she even laments on "Trigger," "All I ever had to say about love is a sad song / I get off on telling everybody what went wrong."
                She continues in interviews, explaining how she doesn't worry about this because so many other groups have
                covered the cases where love goes swimmingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lake Street Dive's "Hypotheticals" is one of the most flowering, soulful, and happy tracks about love I've come across recently
                and it's had me in the best of moods.
            </p>

                I messaged Tamas this week, "hit me with some music," to which he fired back

                This is first song from that performance and I was immediately hooked.
