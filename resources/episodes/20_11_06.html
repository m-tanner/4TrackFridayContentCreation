                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                This week I bring you something from
                a new personal favorite project,
                4 Track's first country song,
                something small from Australia,
                and whacky French tune.
            </p>

                Future Choir | Pray | HÆLOS
            </h2>
            <p>
                I can't get enough of Hælos (pronounced "halos").
                After strolling through my favorite Spotify-curated playlist,
                "Chillout Classics," I stumbled upon "Dust" and my interest piqued.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project began as the London trio of
                Lotti Benardout, Arthur Delaney, and Dom Goldsmith
                trying to make music that unifies their favorite sounds from
                late night, comedown-from-the-club vibes. They undoubtedly succeeded.
                However, they went much farther, bringing together
                the best bits of their influences in a way that outshines them all.
                Neil Z. Yeung described the group aptly
                when he wrote, "[Hælos channels] some of Moby's most uplifting tunes...
                as if the xx had a little more fire in their blood,
                Portishead lightened up a bit, or Massive Attack were a little friendlier."
            </p>
            <p>
                As every host has noticed, it's incredibly difficult to pick a
                single track from almost any artist and this was no different.
                Each of their two albums are best
                experienced as complete efforts, with ups and downs that sum
                to more than their parts. And while the first album
                draws on 90's trip-hop to deliver something solidly downtempo, the
                second distinctly sinks into dark, experimental trip-hop. That's without
                even mentioning their recent EP that displays their coolest and
                most electronic sound design of anything to date. However, I think
                their newer work is best appreciated with an understanding
                of their earlier sound, so I picked my favorite from their
                <a href="https://youtu.be/oERJYbRU9Ts" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">2016 KEXP performance.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Unsurprisingly, my favorite part about Hælos is their
                ability to deliver live, vibrant interpretations of their recorded music.
                Like the transformation that Tycho makes from electronica
                to livetronica that I so much enjoy, it's this that has me hooked.
                The energy and emotion they are able to deliver is difficult to overstate.
            </p>
            <p>
                They've performed in Seattle twice and I can guarantee I'll be at the
                third.

                Outlaw Country | Smalltown Boy | Orville Peck
            </h2>
            <p>
                For this one we have
                a rising country star known for delivering ballads about gay cowboys
                to the masses.
                "Country music listeners want more," Peck said in an interview with Billboard,
                "and they are looking for far more diversity than I think the record
                labels and the radio stations want to give them credit for."
            </p>
            <p>
                While not the first to make gay country music, that honor going to
                Lavender Country in 1973, Peck is definitely at the modern forefront, though
                not purposefully. “I'm not consciously trying to create a new perspective
                for country music, I'm just trying to make a country music album,” he
                continued. “My perspective is the only one I have."
            </p>
            <p>
                Peck recorded this cover for the 2020 Pride edition
                of the Spotify Singles series and I dig the vibe he brings to
                his rendition. It's the perfect amount of drawling croon that doesn't
                sacrifice musicality or lyrical complexity, rather quite the opposite.
            </p>

                Folk-Poptronic | Smart Girls | AYA YVES
            </h2>
            <p>
                Translated from Hebrew, this artist's name means "to fly swiftly" and she firmly believes
                that's what she's meant to do. A recent addition to Canberra's music scene,
                AYA YVES is the reboot of her previous moniker, Vendulka. This track's minimalism
                is its most striking feature, but it's still catchy enough to become an "earworm."

                French Eccentric | Duo | Philippe Katerine, Angèle, Chilly Gonzalez
            </h2>
            <p>
                Joe suggested I check out Chilly Gonzalez a couple weeks ago and I
                quickly discovered this gem. A collaboration with some
                well-known French artists, this one is pure mish-mash. It's part
                of the album that won Philippe Katerine
                <i>Victoires de la Musique's</i> Best Male Artist
                and an absolute delight.
