                Hi Friends!
            </p>
            <p>
                Stephanie, here. I was super excited when Tanner originally asked me to host a FTF and immediately started putting together a playlist. Fast forward a few weeks and the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others have sparked a world-wide revolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I know many of you are, I've been trying to educate myself and make meaningful impacts where I can. I went back to my playlist to try and do just that and made a surprising discovery. Every artist on there was white. Every. Single. One.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unexpected as that was, it was a good wake up call and I'll definitely be trying to expand my music selection in the future. So back to the drawing board I went, and with a little help (shoutout to Hannah, Danielle, and Nick) here are your songs for this Juneteenth!
            </p>

                Experimental Rap | might bang, might not by Little Simz
            </h2>
            <p>
                Little Simz is a new addition to my repertoire, but I was quickly obsessed with the London-based rapper. The track "might bang, might not" is off her newest album, Drop 6, which was produced and released during quarantine earlier this year.

                Soul | Freedom Highway by The Staple Singers
            </h2>
            <p>
                For when you need some inspiration, look no further than The Staple Singers. They began as a family soul group in 1948 Chicago. Mavis Staple's deep and mysterious voice has captured audiences since day one and by the 1960's the group became an influential voice in the civil rights movement. Last year, Mavis celebrated her 80th birthday and she is still creating music today.

                Empowered Hip Hop | I Am Defiant by The Siege
            </h2>
            <p>
                This hip-hop duo emerged into the LA scene in 2015 and into Stephanie's music scene in 2019 while I was putting a ski playlist together. Taz and Goon describe their style as energetic, and their goal is to make their listeners feel empowered - so get ready to send it, brahs.

                New Orleans Hip Hop aka Bounce | Karaoke by Big Freedia ft. Lizzo
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bounce really is the best description for Big Freedia's music. With clear New Orleans influences of the big brass section, it's impossible to sit still while listening to Karaoke. I had the treat of seeing Big Freedia perform live at New Orleans's Jazz Fest and her energy was infectious. She quickly became one of my go-to artists to listen to when I need a confidence boost.
