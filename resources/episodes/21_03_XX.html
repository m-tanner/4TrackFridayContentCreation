                Hey everyone,
            </p>
            <p>
                TANNER - INTRO


            </p>
            <p>
                JOE FIRST - Holland

                Passionately soulful, lyrical, "death where is thy sting"

                transition based on lyricism, but way darker

                TANNER SECOND - NOTES ON C.O.N.F.O.R.M

                Last year, when I got into Cut Chemist and other turntablists, I was reminded of that classic
                producer, DJ Shadow. When I realized I missed his 2019 release, <i>Our Pathetic Age</i>, I knew
                I needed to catch up.

                Digging into the album was a bigger undertaking than I expected, since it's a double-album of half instrumentals / half rap features,
                but I ended up with a handful of new favorites.

                While there are some really fun tracks on the album, this one captures its aim more than the rest.
                Maybe some listeners will be fatigued by the anti social media message, but I can't get enough of it.

                Two bars stick out to me most:
                <blockquote>
                    Can't even lift an eye up away from my phone
                    Talking to Instagram live just so I don't feel alone
                </blockquote>

                And the warning shot lyrics are complimented perfectly by Shadow's samples and eerie production.
                The piano and back-beat drums give it an old school feel, but the stabby synths and glitched out sounds
                make it clear the track is more worried about the future than the past.
            </p>

                JOE THIRD - Skyscrapers

                i didn't know Ok Go could sound like this, ultimate hipster edgy, super clean, minimal

                transition based on ?
            </p>

                TANNER FOURTH - NOTES ON Oh!

                If we're starting a new phase of 4 Track, then you know I have to begin it with some Seattle-Canberra fusion.
                After Elliot introduced me this duo, I was immediately hooked.

                Oh! has one of my favorite two bars in any song, ever.

                <blockquote>
                    I'm building a runway for a paper plane
                    Look at me baby, I'm a runaway
                </blockquote>

                The simple addition of "a" creates an entirely new meaning while perfectly connecting with the theme.

                When listening to this song, it's easy to imagine a separated lover, day dreaming to the point where
                they've built a paper airplane and fancy flying to reunite with their lost one.
