                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                This episode brings us to the end of 2019, a perfectly even
                six month streak of episodes, and sixty listeners.
                Thanks so much to each and every one of you for being a part of this!
            </p>
            <p>
                On that note, please take a minute to pick your four favorite tracks of the year
                in the
                <a href="https://fourtrackfriday.com/FourTrackFriday_survey19.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">end-of-year survey</a>!
            </p>
            <p>
                For some exciting news, I will soon start interviewing artists! The first one will be
                <a href="https://edapollo.bandcamp.com/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">edapollo</a>,
                which is fitting as his track, "Velvia," was sent out on the first episode. I'm grateful to Ed for being
                willing to do this, and excited for what lies ahead!
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, next week you'll be treated to a guest-hosted episode, as I'll be on
                <a href="https://www.cloudmountain.org/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">silent retreat</a>.
                Joseph will take the reigns as he pushes the guest-hosting record up to four episodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that, let's dive into this year's final week. I've even included a a "Christmas song" that
                you can enjoy with your friends and family during this festive time of year.

                Dolewave - The Winnie Blues by Timberwolf
            </h2>
            <a href="https://www.timberwolfmusic.com/lyrics"
               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Lyrics</a>
            <p>
                Up first is a track that I'm loving this winter. Christopher Panousakis is a solo-show out of Adelaide who
                has a real knack for cleverness and humor. After a quick google, I found that his only published bio says,
                "In 2020 you can expect the Tokyo Olympics and Timeberwolf's second album."
            </p>
            <p>
                The production is blues-y, the vocals powerful, and the lyrics witty. The way he phrases things is often times
                disarmingly depressing. Two instances in this song catch my ear and bring a smile to my face on each and every
                listen.
            </p>
            <p>
                He sings, "The doctor said I can't keep singing if I wanna smoke ciggies" and
                "...I spend all my money on coffee / Cos' it's the only thing that makes me feel good when the weather's so / nasty..."
                When you hear these sung and harmonized in context it's just too perfect!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're like me and already awaiting summer, Christopher's here to put words to your feelings.

                Grime - IYKYK (They Know Who) by Hooligan Hefs (feat. HooliganSKINNY)
            </h2>
            <a href="http://www.filterzine.co/posts/hooliganhefs"
               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Interview with Filter</a>
            <p>
                Hefs is a Samoan-Chinese emcee from Sydney's west side, called Doonside.
                He got his start as many emcees do, freestyling in parking lots on the weekend. Eventually, he realized
                he could record something and upload it. That first track can be streamed as "The Party."
            </p>
            <p>
                This track, however, is a lot more like a rap battle than party anthem. It includes plenty of references
                to Hefs' time behind bars, but also to Christmas. Yes, this is the Christmas song. Ho, ho, ho.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reminding me of Hopsin, Snowgoons, and Three 6 Mafia, there's a lot to look forward to from Hefs. He's only getting started.

                Ambient post-rock - The Outer Banks by The Album Leaf
            </h2>
            <a href="http://songexploder.net/the-album-leaf"
               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Song Exploded</a>
            <p>
                Isa recently showed me a podcast called "Song Exploder" and it immediately became my favorite.
                Artists are asked to come and breakdown tracks, samples, inspirations, and then it's edited to
                include those broken down sounds and samples. It's difficult to describe, but easy to enjoy.
                They have everything from electronica like this all the way to hit pop stars, like
                <a href="http://songexploder.net/lorde" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Lorde</a>. I'd heard of The Album Leaf before,
                but never appreciated his music like I do now.
            </p>
            <p>
                "The Outer Banks" comes from Jimmy LaValle's album, "In a Safe Place," which was released five years
                after he he released his first solo-recorded record under this project title.
                The album was recorded at Sigur Rós' studio in Iceland and many of Sigur Rós' members played
                instruments on the tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is some of the most emotional electronica I've found in a while. Lyric-less tunes have
                a special ability to tell a story and this one certainly does. Somehow I find this track especially
                easy to connect with and I hope you do too.

            <p>
                Isa has sent me a ton of musical content lately, even convincing me that I should
                try making music myself. This is also from him. Tune Yards is
                the unique sonic project of Merrill Garbus. Even though
                she started with a ukulele and a loop pedal, the project has expanded in a fully-fledged group.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see the band perform this live at Seattle's best radio station, KEXP,
                <a href="https://youtu.be/wkQomq_rgK4" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>. I'll let Merrill tell you more about
                the song in its "exploded" version and the band in her KEXP interview.
