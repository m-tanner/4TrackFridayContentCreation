                Hello everyone,
            </p>
            <p>
                My name is Mike Wang (almost always said together) and I’m gonna be your guest host for this week’s Four Track Friday. When I started this, I was told there was only one rule and that is you pick four songs and only four songs. However I might have found a secret 2<sup>nd</sup> rule because I have been procrastinating writing this and getting Tanner nervous about getting it out on-time Friday. Sorry, Tanner!
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I hope y’all enjoy the songs I picked out below and stay safe out there. At least I know if you don’t like the songs, I won’t have to show my face for a couple weeks.
            </p>

                GARAGE ROCK | Hacienda Motel by Pickwick
            </h2>
            <p>
                For the local Seattle crowd I’m starting off with a hometown indie hero, Pickwick. Their song Hacienda Motel’s got some groovy rhythms that hit the soul. I think this song blends springy guitar, big clean vocals, and plenty of split tambourines in just the right quantities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pickwick originally started with lead singer Galen Disston before morphing into the current six person crew that released their first album in 2013. Spending time around Seattle when it rapidly expanded earlier this decade, Galen has often spoken about his concerns with the city’s music scene on his podcast, ‘From The Green Room’. It’s definitely something that I am curious to check out more.

                POSITIVE POP | Polaroids by Bravo
            </h2>
            <p>
                There isn’t much info about this next artist. I found him on social media through a parody video of “How to make a song like Post Malone”, but while it was supposed to be comedic, I actually thought the song was really good. So I immediately went to Spotify to see if I could find some more like that. I did not. After getting over my disappointment of not discovering indie Post, I realized that I was also a fan of The Kid Bravo (his insta handle).
            </p>
            <p>
                I would describe Polaroids as a hazy-hypnotic love song. Most of his songs are melodic, echoey, and high energy without being unnatural. Because of this I’ve been using his Spotify channel as a workout playlist when I’m tired of the curated ones. It is so easy to turn my brain off with his music and just groove to the tunes.

                RATCHET R&B | Sade in the 90s by Qveen Herby
            </h2>
            <p>
                Making a 180 degree turn now. My next track is probably by the most well known artist of the list. However, it is probably from her previous band, Karmin. After doing the whole Hollywood thing and making very successful pop music, Amy Heidemann set off for a solo career making music that better fit her creative interests. Thus was born Qveen Herby and the hip hop focused bangers that instantly make you feel cooler just by listening to it. I especially vibe with the dorky word play as well as the impressive vocal skills Qveen Herby busts out on all of her songs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do get down to Karmin’s song Brokenhearted though.

                INDIE FOLK | I Am a War Machine by SONTALK
            </h2>
            <p>
                Maybe the truest artist by definition, SONTALK uses soft-rock warmth to channel deep feelings of sadness. The tranquil voice and reliable guitar chords makes it all worth it though. The artist says his song is “... about recognizing and naming your brokenness and volatility” and the goal is “...to depict the almost accidental way that that innocence is dismantled as we grow up and experience the world.” I’m not gonna pretend that I can fully understand his experiences, but I think it is all authentic in his songs and I can feel the empathy.
