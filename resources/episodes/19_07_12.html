                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s time for round two! Welcome to those of you who are joining for the first time. We’re up to 23
                music lovers now.
            </p>
            <p>
                This week we have a song that came out this morning, a song from 2016, and listener counts ranging
                between one-hundred-thousand and one-million.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve also decided this week that to always include a track from one of you! You’ll find the first one
                below.
            </p>

                Poetic electronica — No Stress by Tycho, Saint Sinner
            </h2>
            <p>
                This track comes from Tycho’s fifth album, which released this morning. For those of you who remember,
                Tycho is half of my answer to the question I love to ask, namely, “If you could only listen to two
                artists for the rest of your life, who would they be?” This album only helps me feel more confident
                about my selection.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the first album from Tycho to include lyrics, I’m pleasantly surprised. Saint Sinner commands a voice
                that glides from one well written word to the next. Touching on premature death, lost love, and hope,
                the lyrics on this track are certainly my favorite.
            </p>

                Revitalizing pop — Back to Life by Fergus James
            </h2>
            <p>
                As soon as I heard this, I knew that I needed to send it out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fergus is a rising artist out of Australia. He recently won a Triple J competition, which will put him
                alongside Chance the Rapper, Catfish and the Bottlemen, and others at Splendor this coming weekend. When
                you listen to this track, which released on June 17th, you'll know why. It’s catchy. It’s dancy. It’s
                clever.

                Sensual hip-hop — Tic Tok by Wongo, Blak Trash
            </h2>
            <p>
                I’ve sent this to one of you before, but I know you won’t mind seeing it again ;)
            </p>
            <p>
                Released on May 22nd to Wongo’s own label, Box of Cats, this track is smooth and sexy. If this kind of
                track is in your wheelhouse, be ready to get turned on. If it’s not, laugh a little and put it on repeat
                for a while. You’ll be happy you did.

                Folk grunge — Emotions and Math by Margaret Glaspy
            </h2>
            <p>
                You guys sent me ten great tracks last week. It was hard to pick just one!
            </p>
            <p>
                Margaret released this track by in 2016, but it’s a discovery to me. I like how direct and relatable the
                track is. It moves simply and tells a story. Somehow she packs a grungy vibe in with an acoustic guitar
                and a little twang. It crosses genres in a way that I enjoy. I wouldn’t have found this on my own.
