                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                To date, this is the closest I've come to sending out a Four Track Saturday... What happened to
                sending these out on Friday mornings??
            </p>
            <p>
                Tons of new music has hit my radar lately, and there's been a ton of community involvement. I love it!
            </p>
            <p>
                Pretty soon <b>I'm going to send out a survey to gage your favorite four tracks of 2019</b>. With that
                in mind,
                make sure you hit up the playlist and start thinking about that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unrelated, but since many of you have been asking recently about my previous and upcoming silent
                retreat experience I have something extra to share this week. With fortuitous timing,
                <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4JTbO8fWfIqsdZPP0RV9Of?si=iwA7R3AxQr-jAi5_v0xiuQ"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">
                    Boreta has released a new track with Alan Watts' voice laid on top</a>.
                Not only is this a great introduction to the practice of mindfulness, but it's also a really beautiful
                combination
                of music and spoken word, which sometimes gives me the feeling of sonically walking through a winter
                forest.
            </p>
            <p>
                And with that, let's listen to some music. This is the first week in a while where I've had a true
                scoop.
                This first song released today!
            </p>

                Electronica - Delphina by Frameworks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes you go to a concert to see an artist you really like. And then, sometimes, you walk away
                thinking,
                "Wow, the opener was even better than who I went for!" Funnily enough, this is how I found Tycho.
                I went to see Phantogram, having never heard of the opener before and now
                Spotify Wrapt tells me Tycho is my favorite artist of the decade.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frameworks is also that way. Some months ago, Alex and I stumbled to a showcase for Emancipator's label,
                where he was also headlining with a DJ set. We didn't even stay for Emancipator's set. Frameworks,
                unearthed accidentally,
                had stolen the show.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the opening track of Matthew Brewer's latest of three studio albums, Imagine Gold, which I've
                listened to several times today.
                It lives up to and is significantly different from his 2017 masterpiece, Kings.
            </p>
            <p>
                While Imagine Gold maintains a slightly organic undertone, it's decidedly more electronic than his
                previous work.
                In fact, Rotations, the penultimate track on the album, is rather easy to dance to. However,
                the introductory track to the album, Delphina, makes a great way to meet the artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like to close my eyes when I listen to this and go on a journey. With its meandering intro,
                keyboard driven transitions, and dancing strings, you'll have to see where it takes you.

                Garage pop - Feeding the Family by Spacey Jane
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you've gotten to know my musical taste, then you know I can't go too long without a new discovery
                that
                convinces me, yet again, that Australia is currently cranking out the best musicians and music.
            </p>
            <p>
                This discovery is completely owed to Spotify, and a much appreciated one. Their break-out song from
                2017,
                "Feeding the Family" has me whistling and singing along every time.
                Sometimes you really just have to grind through some shit and Caleb, Kieran, Ashton, and Peppa are here
                to get you through it.
                Someone's got to feed the family, and sometimes it's you.

                Psychedelic - Yes I'm Changing by Tame Impala
            </h2>
            <p>
                With Kevin Parker's recently headlining at massive festivals, I doubt you need me
                to tell you who Tame Impala is. However, I doubt you've heard this track. I certainly hadn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming from Kaitlin's favorite album, Currents, this track's lyrics strike me as the most reflective and
                moving.
                In fact, Parker says they were so stream-of-consciousness that he doesn't even remember writing them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The track is fantastic as it slowly sways from side to side as if with the wind in a dream.
                Add the grounding bass line and Parker's wispy lyrics and you have something truly ethereal.
                In a stroke of genius Parker rips you back to reality at the end of the track with traffic sounds, just
                like your alarm would in the morning.
                Luckily you can always tap "rewind."

                Math pop - Heard It All Before by Bend Sinister
            </h2>
            <p>
                You sit down to dinner and you think, "Wow, this waiter is great." You find it easy to have a good time
                in
                the atmosphere of the restaurant, which you've decided is fantastic. The waiter proves a rare
                combination
                of interesting, entertaining, and genuine. You get to talking and ask how he spends his time when he's
                not helping
                hungry patrons decide between the Poutine and Pierogi. "I play in a band," he says. You hardly believe
                him,
                but you look him up. Then you play his top song. And it's this song. And it's become your favorite.
            </p>
            <p>
                That's the story you'd tell if you were Scott and had just vacationed in Vancouver. Lucky for the rest
                of us,
                he shared this one with me when he stopped by Seattle on his way back down to sunny California.
            </p>
            <p>
                While many bands are difficult to classify, Bend Sinister is one of the most difficult I've found, right
                there with PVRIS.
                You can hear elements of classic rock, modern pop, punk, and more as they weave between bold intro,
                rhythmic verse, and catchy chorus. This one will have you turning up your car stereo for weeks to come.
