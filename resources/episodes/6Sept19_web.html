                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                We’ve reached our first two-digit week number; it’s week ten!
            </p>
            <p>
                For a short housekeeping segment this week, I’d like to let you all know that Joseph and his roommate, Nate, will be the guest hosts for September. Get stoked for what will likely be hip hop heavy.
            </p>
            <p>
                And for those of you that loved Tones and I in week three, I encourage you to check out her EP, which finally released last week!
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let’s get to the music!
            </p>

                Funk — Settle - Daju Remix by BAYNK
            </h2>
            <p>
                BAYNK certainly enjoys some popularity already, so I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve already heard of him, but I’ve been dying to send this out since I first heard it.
            </p>
            <p>
                What’s so special about this remix is that I actually like it, which is exactly the opposite of how I feel about the original track. In other words, this remix is FIRE.
            </p>
            <p>
                The soft, layered vocals, the groove, and the solo at the end that reminds me of Tiger Love’s Pussy Cocaine, which is just fantastic.

                Math rock — Finger - Audiotree Live Version by Elephant Gym
            </h2>
            <p>
                I hear the questions already, “what’s math rock?” Don’t worry… I’ll feed you baby birds. It’s a real genre, defined as rock with enough rhythmical complexity to be dubbed “mathematical.”
            </p>
            <p>
                This threesome from Taiwan is comprised of a brother and sister who cover guitar and bass, respectively, while their friend plays drums. I highly recommend you watch the whole live set, which even includes the bassist sharing how her mother hates her music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sam sent me this song a week ago and I immediately loved it. I also noticed the group is coming to Seattle at the end of October, and immediately bought a ticket. See you there!

                Pop — Sick of Loving You by BOI
            </h2>
            <p>
                I think I had to wait a month to get this song out. I first heard it on my favorite Australian music podcast, but it didn’t hit the American streaming services for weeks! Finally it’s here and you get to decide if it was worth the wait.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anna Buckingham (a.k.a. BOI) is a completely new solo act out of Australia (though she has been the vocalist for other groups, including The Chainsmokers, before), with only two tracks uploaded to Spotify. However, as you can hear on this track, she’s destined to be a pop superstar.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the catchy hook and glittery production, this one is sure to play well on your car stereo.

                Hip hop — Till the End by Logic
            </h2>
            <p>
                Joseph played Logic while we were driving around during his visit this past weekend and led me to rediscover this track, which was the outro on Logic’s first full length album, “Under Pressure.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Logic is also one of Tenzin’s “if I only had two artists for the rest of my life” answers and I remember when he showed me the first Young Sinatra mixtape, which includes some of my favorite Logic tracks, like Shine On and Let Me Go. With those half-dozen reasons, this track had to land in week ten.
