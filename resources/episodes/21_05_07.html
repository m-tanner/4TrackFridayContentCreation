                Hello friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                For the first time in a long time, I'm writing an episode from somewhere other than Seattle.
                Different places bring different inspiration
                and tapping back into that is a treat.
            </p>
            <p>
                This week we have four tracks that I've been loving lately. It's hard to say
                that I like one more than any others because they are all so different, but this
                first one takes me to another place more so than the rest.
            </p>

                Neo Classical | All Res | GoGo Penguin
            </h2>
            <p>
                This one comes to us from the British three-piece known for its jazz, rock, and electronica/ambient
                influences. They cite Aphex Twin as particularly inspiring their complex arrangements, which
                has to be my favorite feature on this one.
            </p>
            <p>
                The drumming is so complex that I have no hope of ever successfully tapping along
                (though that doesn't keep me from trying).
                The piano beautifully and tirelessly dances for the entire five minute run time
                while the string bass provides deep roots for the song in all directions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whirling at times, somber at others "All Res," like many of the other tracks on their 2016
                <i>Man Made Object</i>, is an acoustic journey. A musical masterpiece.

                Meme Hop | Tight Jeans | Boomchild
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you have a pulse and anything but a loathing for hip hop, this one is sure to light
                up your mood. The arrogance on display is so overtly overdone and masterfully matched
                by the production quirks that your mouth might actually be watering by the end.
            </p>
            <p>
                Complete with literal meme soundbytes sprinkled in, this Sydney-based music collective
                makes it clear that they're as plugged into modern internet culture as they are
                into their creativity in the studio. They released their first single in 2019, followed
                by two more last year. I don't know about you, but I'll be eagerly awaiting their first
                release of 2021.

                Bubblegum Pop | This Is Why We Fall Apart | STUMPS
            </h2>
            <p>
                If you ever find yourself pining for bygone groups like Two Door Cinema Club,
                then do I have the act for you! Picking up where the mainstay indie groups of the early 2000's left off, STUMPS is
                here to take it to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
                On their <i>All Our Friends</i>, which released last year, you can distinctly hear
                Bloc Party on "Mt. Pleasant," Talking Heads on "I've Had Enough," Foals on "Suburbia,"
                and of course Two Door on this one. Since discovering this album earlier this week,
                I've played it though probably a dozen times, tickling those college era vibes
                but in a totally fresh way.
            </p>
            <p>
                "This Is Why We Fall Apart" is particularly my favorite exactly because it goes
                after bores who never grow up, antiquated bro culture, and the lame aversion
                to expressing the way you feel. The verses bring fresh complaints against it all
                while the chorus loudly pleads for the solution, with the stark difference between
                the two being exactly... why we fall apart.

                Illegal Funk | Exist | Promnite
            </h2>
            <p>
                When Spencer sent me this track, I fell in love. Leading off with
                some simple synth arpeggios, deep, deep synth bass quickly follows.
                Then, setting the mood for the rest of the track, Paul "PJ" Sledge
                hits us with the perfect vocal sample.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beautifully balancing the rest of track with high samples, snappy guitars,
                and that ever present drum 'n' bass, this NYC born but LA-based producer
                delivers a chilled out dance track perfect for anytime of year. And remember...
            </p>
            <p>
                "Nothin' but the funk / so help me funk / everybody."
