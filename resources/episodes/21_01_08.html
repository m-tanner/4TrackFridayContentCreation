                Hello friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                Today I'm back to bring you an episode that I didn't write. After looking at the
                responses from the Wrapped survey I sent out a few weeks ago, I picked out four songs and today we have
                Elliot, Eric, Victoria, and Alex here to tell you about their top track of 2020. They'll take it from here.
            </p>

                X | Reckless | Healy
            </h2>
            <p>
                From Elliot:
            </p>
            <p>
                I've never really been a big hip hop buff, but over the past year or so Healy has slowly worked his way into a lot of my bread and butter playlists.
                His music has a kicked back, casual air about it that's polished and really easy to get into.
                I'm a big fan of the production on Reckless (shoutout Biskwiq) – it's textured but not busy, catchy but not repetitive, rhythmic but not robotic.
                The melody and kicks feel as much a part of the song as the lyrics, instead of just being there like a plain chip for the rap salsa.
                Also, how can anyone say no to a little lo-fi sampling? You KNOW I'm out here studying/relaxing to these chill beats.

                X | Some Kind of Disaster | All Time Low
            </h2>
            <p>From Eric:</p>
            <p>
                Ever since it popped up on my Release Radar one day, the whole album, <i>Wake Up, Sunshine,</i> including the opening track, Some Kind of Disaster, has been my go to for some fun, feel good music.
                Its soft opening, which transitions to a pop punk anthem gets me pumped up every time. As the months at home have worn on, I've kept coming back to this.
                We're all living through some kind of disaster right now, and "It’s all downhill ’til it’s a climb / Through blood and tears but I don’t mind / I’ll just keep singing on and on and on."
            </p>
            <p>
                The Seattleites among us might also empathize with the track "January Gloom" as we head further into our winter as well...
            </p>

                X | With You - LöKii Remix | Kaskade
            </h2>
            <p>
                From Victoria:
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy New Year all! This one is "With You" by Kaskade, but the LöKii Remix.
                According to my Spotify wrapped, Kaskade was my top artist of 2020 and I spent over two thousand minutes listening to his music......that doesn't include his live sets on SoundCloud or YouTube.
                I'm a huge EDM fan and Kaskade has been a driving force in that genre for over a decade.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not sure if I could pick a favorite track of his to be honest.
                Clearly, though, this one is right up there. This is also one of those rare instances where I believe the remix (at least this particular one) is better than the original.
                Make no mistake, the original is a truly fun song. It's full of flirty vocals from Meghan Trainor and a bouncy, pop-like rhythm you can't help but dance to.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why do I like LöKii's remix better? I'm glad you asked. LöKii dials back the vocals and focuses on the beat.
                Much to my pleasure, LöKii transforms this pop track into something much more rhythmic with a deep house vibe (making it much more low-key.....LöKii).
                In doing so, the track becomes something you not only hear, but feel.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm one of those people that always seems to attach memories to songs.
                Ever hear a song and remember where you were and what you were doing when you first heard it? This is one of those songs for me. I hope you love it as much as I do!
