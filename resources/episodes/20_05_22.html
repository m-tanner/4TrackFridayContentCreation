                Hello everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                Joseph here! It's great to be back to host another week after the miscommunication between Michael and me last week. I hope everyone has been staying safe and, probably more importantly, staying sane during quarantine. I'm hoping that the music this week will lift your mood a bit if you're feeling down. With that, sit back, mix yourself a quarantini, and let's get into the music!
            </p>

                Upbeat hip hop | Looking for You by Yonas
            </h2>
            <p>
                This one is probably my favorite for the week. I discovered Yonas back in 2013 when he was super small and only on Soundcloud. He's an incredibly nice guy that has managed to stay humble even while amassing around 400k monthly listeners on Spotify. He and I used to actually DM on twitter about his music and random stuff which was super cool.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've been following him off-and-on but no matter what, I always find myself going back to some of his older stuff with "The Transition" being my favorite album. Since I can only send one Yonas song, I went with <i>Looking for You</i> which is improbably catchy with flow that will have you keeping this one on repeat for a while.

                Luscious lo-fi | The Dream by SwuM
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have found that lo-fi is my favorite kind of music. Whenever I'm reading, writing, coding, chilling, or doing just about anything, I have it on in the background. I'm particularly into this one as it features samples from Alan Watts and what I believe is from Rachael in the must see movie "Blade Runner." Kick back, relax, and forget all about covid with this one.

                Vocal-centric electric rock | Stay In by Jaws
            </h2>
            <p>
                As soon as I heard "Stay In", I decided I needed to put it in a 4TF episode. JAWS is an English indie rock band made up of three friends from college that got their start in 2012. The laid back vibe paired with the electric rock had me digging this track from the get-go.

                Oddly emotional hip hop | Crash by Witt Lowry
            </h2>
            <p>
                I don't know what it is about Witt Lowry but his songs always seem to hit hard, especially so with this one. While he can be a bit repetitive track-to-track, I haven't been able to get enough of this song. His emotion comes across as raw and genuine as he reflects on his relationship that's almost brought to a premature end. It's a nice change from hip hop artists that seem to only be able to talk about how much money they have after coming from nothing (looking at you Logic.....we get it).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're really feeling this track, I highly recommend you give <i>Tourist</i> a listen in addition to <i>Hurt</i>. Both have similar vibes and are equally as genuine. Bottomline: I'm on a Witt Lowry kick at the moment.
