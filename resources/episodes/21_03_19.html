                The funnier, more attractive, and most importantly your favorite
                Tanner brother is back on the sticks for a bangers-only week of 4TF.
                The weather is getting nicer here in D.C.
                so I feel like giving you all some songs to bump to on the way to play some sand volleyball with the crew.

                Windows Down Feels | Drive | Glades
            </h2>
            <p>
                We‚Äôre starting off this week with my favorite windows down drive song of the week: "Drive."
                I accidentally went along with Michael‚Äôs long running theme of adding bopping Aussie music to the playlist
                with this one but maybe Australia just does it better.
                Glades have released many many more stellar songs since "Drive" came out in 2016
                but this is the one that put them on the map around the globe.
                If you dig this one as much as I do, check out some of their newer stuff too!

                Ear-Worm Banger | Lion | Hearts & Colors
            </h2>
            <p>
                I can‚Äôt think of a better description for this song than ‚Äúabsolute banger.‚Äù
                When I first found this one, my industrial sized speaker (the same one Michael has) was booming.
                I could tell this song was 10/10 sick because even my neighbors liked it.
                Whenever I was blasting it, they joined in by hitting the wall between our apartments.
                They were never quite on beat but they were still obviously getting down to it!

            </h2>
            <p>
                Now this wouldn‚Äôt be a week from me without some synthwave/retrowave.
                I previously blessed you with "After Dark" and now I‚Äôm turning even more water into wine
                (or White Claws if I‚Äôm hip Jesus) with this nutty track.
                This group is a staple on my retrowave playlist and for good reason.
                They pump out track after track that is absolutely perfect for any drive, rain or shine.
                They have more upbeat songs like "Dance or Die" or more lusciously laid back tracks like "He^rt."
                Give them a look üëÄ

                The Best of 4TF | Kangaroo Court - Forever Kid Remix | Capital Cities
            </h2>
            <p>
                This is now the best song on the entire 4TF playlist; hands down.
                If you disagree, I will personally hack Michael‚Äôs computer and unsubscribe you from the mailing list.
                The energy is exhilarating. The beat is bodacious. The song is trance-inducing in its totality.
                This is the song to play as you and your friends show up fashionably late to the house party and KNOW that you‚Äôre going to be the life of the party.
                Take that board game night and turn it into an impromptu summer rager courtesy of Kangaroo Court.
