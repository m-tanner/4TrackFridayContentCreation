                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                Welcome back for another week. I'm happy to say that the Four Track website has come
                a long way since I began working on it some months ago. If you're craving the ability to
                read through or share an old episode, that's something you can do now! Check it out for
                yourself at <a href="https://4trackfriday.com" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">4trackfriday.com</a>.
                The next thing I want is the ability for you to make user accounts and
                interact with each other. Hold your breath, it's right around the corner!
            </p>

                Something exciting happened last week.
                Kevin Parker, otherwise known as Tame Impala, released a fascinating project.
                Last week, he brought us
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/EA9uRfOJgM0" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Slow Rush in an Imaginary Place</a>,"
                which is you listening to a Tame Impala concert, but playing in a nearby room. The man himself
                demands that you listen to this with headphones on and I must pass the recommendation along; it makes
                a huge difference. While there are no concerts to attend, try this out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now for this week's tunes. I don't know how it happened, but I've been into some pretty groovy stuff lately. Thus,
                this week aims almost exclusively at stuff that makes your head move. Let's get into it.

                Lo-fi groove | Per la Luna by Bad Snacks
            </h2>
            <p>
                I want to lead this week off with something that released <i>today</i>. Bad Snacks has a
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBCI_QCAMe1hx8UNyvJlM_Q" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">YouTube channel</a>
                that's similar to the oh-so-famous
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Red Means Recording</a>.
                Her channel is made up of videos breaking down how she made songs, production tips, and other musical content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two years ago, she released
                "<a href="https://badsnacks.bandcamp.com/album/neat-tape-1" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Neat Tape <i>1</i></a>,"
                and, you guessed it, this one comes from
                "<a href="https://badsnacks.bandcamp.com/album/neat-tape-2" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Neat Tape <i>2</i></a>,"
                The sounds on both are delightfully varied. Sometimes she gets pretty digital,
                other times stays lo-fi. Sometimes she's on a fat back-beat rhythm, other times opting for four on the floor.
            </p>
            <p>
                This one's closer to lo-fi and really showcases her ability to shove out an organic groove.
                She's even got her signature strings on here (she started playing classical violin around the age of 3).
                It's one that'll keep your head bobbing and your ears happy.
                If you like it, maybe you'll even pick up some of her tips and give music making a shot yourself!

                Bassy groove | Wander With Me by Tom Misch (feat. Carmody)
            </h2>
            <p>
                I found Tom Misch via Bad Snacks' video
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/9Ta03xOotss" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Misch and Chips</a>."
                After checking out what he had on Spotify, which is a satisfyingly large amount, I found that this is the one
                I kept on repeat the longest. The low-slung, bass-heavy groove is just what I need right now. Add
                Carmody's silky smooth vocals atop and it's something I can enjoy all night.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dude started releasing music from England in 2012 after learning how to play the violin at the
                age of 4 (wow, a lot of violin players end up groove stars). He's released a couple beat tapes,
                a few extended plays, and one album. Let's hope there's lots more to come.

                Poppy groove | Girls by Vetta Borne
            </h2>
            <p>
                Someone is <b>slapping</b> the thicker strings on this one and I've been absolutely digging it.
            </p>
            <p>
                This one comes from the Melbourne-based producer and multi-instrumentalist, Maribelle.
                Recently she rebranded as "Vetta Borne" and this is off her new EP.
                After producing George Alice's smash hit, <i>Circles</i>, last year it's good to see that
                Mariabelle is doing it all now.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an interview with Triple J during the radio premier of this track, Maribelle said,
                "I actually wrote this one on my bed. I was super hungover from a big night and the only thing I could remember from the night before was getting dumped."
                I'm sorry that happened, but I'm happy she wrote this. Maybe you know the feeling and,
                if you do, the bop on this one might just make you forget about it.

                House groove | Eyes - Live from Joshua Tree by RÜFÜS DU SOL
            </h2>
            <p>
                Jackie texted me the other day to ask if I'd heard RÜFÜS DU SOL. After replying in the negative
                I received a handful of welcome recommendations for what I should listen to first. One of those
                was the Sydney trio's recently released
                <a href="https://youtu.be/Zy4KtD98S2c" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">live performance from Joshua Tree</a>.
                The whole project is worth a listen as it's quite exciting and flows well (it is a continuous live set after all).
                The video is especially good, being well shot and uploaded in 4K. They played
                at exactly the right time for sunset to occur about halfway through and, once the sky is black,
                their stage setup becomes a highlight of the experience.
