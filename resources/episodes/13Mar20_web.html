                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you're all healthy in this time of worldwide crisis. Fortunately, however, these
                songs <i>are</i> <b>sick</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This week is a flip! I've got three track here that were sent in by you lovely people and only one
                from me. I still have no fewer than eight community tracks in the queue. I'll have to do episodes like
                this more often; keep sending in the tracks!
            </p>

                Brittany showed me this fresh one from 21-year-old Tucker Pillsbury a couple of weeks ago on our way
                to Ballard. Considering himself among the young and current crowd of artists getting real about mental health,
                Pillsbury digs into some pretty sad stuff. Additionally, his production isn't overdone, remaining rather
                understated and melancholic. This track in particular was inspired by a time after a skiing accident
                when Pillsbury was spending a lot of time alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the interview linked above, Tucker says, "It's just that music seems to be the outlet that
                every person is using to get their point across [about depression and anxiety]...
                I like to mask these things under pretty pianos and happy melodies,
                and try to lift people... But if you really dig deep into the lyrics
                you're going to hear the darker side of what I'm actually saying."
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a catchy one, but indeed unhappy. The light guitar picked over top the upper register
                vocals and deep piano create a downtempo vibe that's easy to consume, especially when it's dark out.

                Futuristic nostalgia | Jump Hi by LION BABE (feat. Childish Gambino)

            <p>
                Tenzin was on a soul binge a little while ago and, from that, discovered LION BABE. Once he clued me in,
                I listened to their 2016 album <i>Begin</i> half a dozen times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jillian Hervey, the daughter of Vanessa Williams, and Lucas Goodman are making
                what they deem to be "futuristic nostalgia." Originally connecting at a party, the
                duo encourage an organic process. "It's a lot of freestyling and trying to capture a moment," Goodman
                says. "You have to go on what you're feeling in the moment..."
                The two have definitely found their energy as a duo, becoming so close that they even finish each
                others' sentences in interviews.
            </p>
            <p>
                Donald Glover first caught wind of LION BABE at 2013's South by Southwest festival. Immediately afterward,
                he invited the two to join him on tour and lent them a verse on this track. The three delivered
                a strong energy about ambition and versatility. With a production that combines elements of
                soul, pop, and electronic, Hervey and Glover pierce through with strong verses. If you like this, be sure
                to check out the whole album top to bottom for the fourteen-track version of this vibe.

                This is another track from Travis' "check out these sick drums" playlist. Well, not only does this
                track have head-bob and hip-sway inducing drums, but it's also got some oh-so-satisfyingly clever lyrics.

                Amir Mohamed is a D.C. based rapper born to Sudanese and African-American parents. As he grew up in
                Maryland, he was heavily influenced by soul and rap. Unlike most rap these days, Amir refreshingly imparts
                actual knowledge and inspiration to his listeners. Allowing art to imitate life, tracks released by
                Oddisee are wonderfully filled with stories, concerns, and lessons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Much like the earlier Four Track entry, "Murdahh" by Lil Spacely, this one's all about hard work
                and fate or, possibly, the lack thereof. If you're not ambitious, this track might make you so for
                about four minutes. No promises on the half life, though.

                Smooth grooves | Serious by The Whitest Boy Alive
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/W7N5Oq9fl68"
               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live in Prague</a>
            <p>
                The Whitest Boy Alive is the one of the best alternative/indie rock groups I've heard come out since
                the turn of the new millennium. These four Germans and Norwegians released their first album in 2006 before
                a second in 2009. However, it was all radio silence after that. Heartrendingly, the band broke up
                or ended or something.
            </p>
            <p>
                Until now! The band reformed last year and then released this single last week. Oh how I've missed them.
                They have this smooth, funky sound while maintaining the clear indie rock vibe. Then Erlend Øye
                brings these saliently simple lyrics with an easeful delivery. It's a sound I can't get enough of.
            </p>
            <p>
                I highly encourage you to check out their three song live set in the video linked above. It's amazing
                how much pizazz they bring to the stage. I'd love to see it for myself.
