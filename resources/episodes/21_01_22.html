                On New Year's day, <a href="https://www.edbidgood.com/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Ed Bidgood</a> posted
                to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/edapollouk" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">edapollo's Facebook page</a> writing,
                "New year, new music, new project... [I'm] happy to share the first track from my new ambient side project Sundreamer."
                Now three weeks later, today marks the release of the remaining four tracks as part of the project's first EP, <i>Unwind Tape</i>.
                After <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_01_17.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">speaking with me previously</a>,
                he was kind enough to sit do it again ahead of this debut release. We kicked off our discussion with a reflection on last year.
            </p>
            <p>
                "2020 was a really surreal year and I think it’s tested everyone in different ways," Ed began.
                "I took the extra time I had to focus more energy than ever into my music, which came with its positives and negatives."
            </p>
            <p>
                And he isn't kidding. After releasing <i>Endless Cascades</i> in August last year,
                Ed has released six singles. Half were collaborations, which Ed says
                "has been fun during lockdown.
                It's allowed me to feel connected to other artists while pushing my sonic boundaries a little bit further and explore new ideas."
            </p>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/ijSm8IGUdpQ" target="_blank">
                <img alt=""
                     src="https://4trackfriday.com/artist_media/edapollo_koresma_paintTheSky.jpg"
                     style="border-radius: 4px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; max-width: 100%; min-width: 100px; width: 100%;"
                />
            </a>
            <p>
                "Unfortunately, the negative side was developing tinnitus, which has caused me a lot of stress at points throughout the year,"
                Ed continued.
                "I think the arrival of my tinnitus influenced the Sundreamer tracks directly, as I needed to work on some much softer music.
                I initially didn’t think much about releasing them, it was more of just a creative outpouring of simple ideas for fun,
                mostly based less around my computer and production and more about playing guitar or piano."
            </p>
            <p>
                In fact, this simplicity is central to Sundreamer. Ed explains,
                "This is a project which I’m allowing myself to take the ‘less is more’ approach more literally.
                I love exploring more complex arrangements, sound design and upbeat ideas with edapollo.
                With Sundreamer I want to keep things more stripped back, ambient and minimal.
                Listeners will hear edapollo in Sundreamer and vice versa, but for me this new project just felt right for some of the creations I’ve been making."
            </p>
            <img alt=""
                 src="https://4trackfriday.com/artist_media/sundreamer_3.jpg"
                 style="border-radius: 4px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; max-width: 100%; min-width: 100px; width: 100%;"
            />
            <p>
                However, he never planned to release the tracks.
                "I reached a point where I had a collection of these tracks that didn’t quite fit with the more full bodied production vibe of edapollo and, after showing them to friends,
                they convinced me I should release them anyway, so I decided it felt right to release them under a different name.
                I actually have another whole Sundreamer EP almost done too as these tracks were finished over 6 months ago!"
            </p>
            <p>
                When asked about artistic influences, Ed brought up a wide range of acts, saying,
                "<a href="https://youtu.be/W8A5DQAFL1M" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Bibio</a> is a big influence on the sound.
                I love the warped guitars and delicate field recordings he uses, which are techniques I’ve explored in Sundreamer.
                <a href="LINK TO TRACK" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">NAME OF TRACK</a> is inspired by artists like
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_12_18.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Nils Frahm</a> and
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_11_20.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Ólafur Arnalds</a>.
                Other influences include my love for guitar music, you’ll probably hear hints of post-rock artists like
                <a href="https://youtu.be/tLzIuL8xzgM" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Explosions in the Sky</a> and perhaps a touch of
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_11_20.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Khruangbin</a>."

            />
            <h4 style="text-align: center">Boards of Canada</h4>
            <p>
                Oddly enough, one of the best showcases for Bibio's sound is Boards of Canada's "Chromakey Dreamcoat."
            </p>
            <p>
                After Stephen Wilkinson released Bibio's 2004 <i>Fi</i>, Boards officially cited this album as a "discovery" and
                influence for their next record, <i>The Campfire Headphase</i>.
                On this track, you are treated to a delightful presentation everything Ed mentions.

            />
            <h4 style="text-align: center">Jamison Isaak of Teen Daze</h4>
            <p>
                As for what Ed's been listening to over the past year, it's more Teebs! However, unlike last interview,
                this time he mentions Khruangin, Teen Daze, and Washed Out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Teen Daze is... makes...

                This is...

            <p>
                Washed Out is a bit more <a href="https://kexp.org/read/2020/8/13/washed-out-purple-noon-interview/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">sensual</a>.
