            <p>
                You'll remember Cherry Tomato from their <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/show/episodes/20_11_13.html" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">November 13th-shared track</a> "Unscrew.Me".
                After Jocelyn put me in touch with Anya, the Seattle-base three-piece basement grunge act agreed to do an interview
                and that's what we have for this week's episode!
                The three absolutely cracked me up and I hope I can get that through in this interview.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three of them grew up in nearby Sammamish, WA, where Anya and Vivian became friends in middle school.
                Anya could play piano and Vivian guitar, but they knew they wanted to start a band.
                Needing a drummer, they actually put an ad out on Facebook. Liv answered the call and the band was formed,
                though originally with fourth member acting as the vocalist.
            </p>
            <p>
                The group broke up when the older two went off to college, but once Liv joined them the effort resumed
                without missing a beat. This time it consisted of only the three of them and became known as Cherry Tomato.
            </p>
            <p>
                Liv: As for the name “Cherry Tomato” … Anya and Viv were drunk--<br/>
                Viv: Tipsy at most!<br/>
                Liv: ... after a house show at the Mirage Garage and were waiting for the bus.
                Vivian found a cherry tomato on a trash can and dared Anya to eat it.
                Our stomachs churned as Anya picked it up without hesitation… The rest is history.<br/>
                Anya: It tasted like fish… Vivian said she would pay me $5 to eat it, yet to this day I have never been paid…
            </p>
            <p>
                Why start a band now? How has quarantine impacted your creative time?<br/>
                Anya: We actually started our band in April of 2019 when we saw that UW’s Rainy Dawg Radio was having a Battle of the Bands, and we wanted to participate in it. We sent in a submission video of us playing together, and got chosen to be one of the 5 bands that performed. We have officially been a band ever since!
                Liv: We’ve shifted the bulk of our effort to creating merch, releasing Unscrew.Me, engaging with our audience etc. We sunk a ton of money into t-shirts and tye dye and screen printing material. Totally worth it. Miss the music though lol.
                Anya: Yeah, we had plans to record an EP after the single, but because of lockdown we have had to put that on hold, which is too bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                Have you ever performed live? Do you plan to?<br/>
                Anya: Yes, after we started our band in 2019 we played roughly 2-4 shows per month until March of 2020, when the pandemic started.
                Viv: We played so many shows! We used to play like once a week; it was so fun and I really miss it. I know we're all looking forward to playing again. Fingers crossed!!

            <h4 style="text-align: center">Vivian (guitar/vocals) in the zone</h4>
            <p>
                Viv: Oooooooh good question! This might almost be cheating, but I would probably go MF Doom and Arctic Monkeys. Do your ears a solid and (if you haven't already) go listen to Lavender Buds by MF Doom and Secret Door by Arctic Monkeys. Both are pretty deep cuts depending on who you ask, and both are very representative of the things I admire most about each artist. They both have large, diverse, and honestly timeless discographies, so I think I could listen to them forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's your songwriting process like? Do you use any workflow to help get you through sticking points? What role does creative breakthrough play in your work?<br/>
                *we collectively look at Vivian*
                Viv: Oh gosh, I dunno. I keep a Google doc with all my ideas for tabs or chords or lyrics and it's all incredibly chaotic. I tend to start with a solid bass line, or some lyrics, and I build from there. Otherwise, I don't have much of a process! I guess I view it as a hobby and form of expression so if I plan too much it's not as fun. Most of my songs and lyrics are born from real life experiences, usually things that are impacting me at the time. There's no way to plan life experiences, haha!
                Anya: When I write songs, they usually just fall out of my brain all at once. Like I’ll go for months and months without writing a song and then one day I’ll just sit down and write an entire song (lyrics, melody, instrumentation, etc.) from start to finish. Not sure why it happens that way…
                Liv: it's nice working together too, if someone is stuck on a part, you have two other people who can help you think of something.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to their process, they also have their influences...


                What are some songs or artists that have influenced your own music? Where has this influence particularly left its mark?
                Viv: I absolutely love Led Zeppelin's riff constructions and tone. Always trying to recreate that in some way.
                Anya: I went through a long grunge phase in high school, so I think that has had a big influence on me. I listened to a lot of Nirvana, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, etc.
                Viv: Oh, definitely... grunge is big. It's a perfect balance of lyricism and raw emotional energy.
                Liv: I like to stuff “groove” into the part. Led Zeppelin is huge for that.
                Anya: My favorite genres currently are nu-metal (which everyone hates on, I know), indie pop, pop-punk, emo rock, and math rock. It would be impossible to name all the artists from these genres that have influenced me.

            <p>
                Anya: That’s an easy question for me: Paramore and The Smashing Pumpkins. Paramore because they have been my favorite band for a very long time and their music has gotten me through a lot of hardships in my life (or “hard times” -- get it?). The Smashing Pumpkins because their album “Siamese Dream'' is probably my favorite album of all time, and it has my favorite song of all time on it, which is “Mayonnaise.”

                Liv: Elliott Smith and Bill Wurtz… I know that combo doesn't make any sense. I love DIY stuff where one person plays all the instruments, does all the production, does all the songwriting etc. It makes everything sound so personal. Check out St. Ides Heaven by Elliott, La de Da de Da de Da De Day Oh by Bill.

                How do you approach music theory? Is it something that should be learned through study, experimentation, or both?
                Anya: I was taught basic music theory at a young age by my piano teacher, and I definitely think it has helped me as a musician. I have continued to teach myself music theory on my own, and I mostly teach myself through a combination of studying, experimentation, and watching YouTube videos about it.
                Liv: Imo “music theory” is an inflexible term for arbitrary rules about Western music. However, music “theories” are stuff you come up with your whole life. You invent your own standards and rules that make you sound like you. For drums, you gotta listen and experiment like you said. Then just do what you think sounds good! Make sure you know “why” it sounds good though…
                Viv: Damnnn that's very true though. The rigidity of those rules is partially why I quit playing violin when I was young. I will say it can really help to articulate my musical thoughts, so I typically only "study" music theory when I'm trying to put thoughts to words and explore new avenues of creativity. But doing that is not at all necessary to the creative process, as Liv said.
            </p>
            <p>
                What does the phrase “imposter syndrome” mean to you, if anything?
                *Raucous laughter*
                Viv: The music industry can be a total bro zone. Not that we always know what we're doing, but we've run into a lot of dudes that assume that they know more than we do, especially vis-a-vis the technical aspects of music. It can be difficult not to internalize that.
                Liv: Nothing to me; I feel like we’ve earned our name. We worked very hard to play tons of shows- even planning our own at Anya and Viv’s old place. Viv’s right though, it’s such a bro-zone out there. We were playing a festival when this dude comes up and asks if we’re a Heart cover band. What??
                Viv: Oh yeah… that was whack as fuck.

                This brings us to the end of the episode.

                If people say something about your music or your band, what do you hope it is?
                Viv: I would hope that other QPOC identify with the experiences that our music speaks to. Or that we bop. Either is fine. Haha!
                Anya: Same, and I also hope that other women or non-binary folx identify with our music as well, or feel inspired by us. I rarely see bands like ours with all femme/non-binary members in them.
                Liv: “I would hire them”
