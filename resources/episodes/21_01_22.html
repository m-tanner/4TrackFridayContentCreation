                Here’s the answers… hope they’re ok for you. :)

                2020 was a bad year for some, a crazy one for many, and a weird one for everyone else. However, it also provided opportunities unthinkable in "normal" times. What did the year mean for you? Would Sundreamer exist without the pandemic and its associated lockdown? When did you start making tracks that would eventually fall under the Sundreamer project?

                It was a a really surreal year and I think it’s tested everyone in different ways. I took the extra time I had to focus more energy than ever in to my music, which came with both it’s positives and negatives. Unfortunately the negative side was developing tinnitus which has caused me a lot of stress at points throughout the year. I think the arrival of my tinnitus influenced the Sundreamer tracks directly, as I needed to work on some much softer music for my ears. I initially didn’t think much about releasing them, it was more of just a creative outpouring of simple ideas for fun, mostly based less around my computer and production and more about playing guitar or piano. I reached a point where I had a collection of these tracks that didn’t quite fit with the more full bodied production vibe of edapollo and after showing them to friends, they convinced me I should release them anyway, so I decided it felt right to release them under a different name. I actually have another whole Sundreamer EP almost done too as these tracks were finished over 6 months ago!

                In the Spotify "About" for Sundreamer, you've simply written "Songs I make to help me relax." What's different about making an "edapollo track" versus a "Sundreamer track?"

                In terms of process, Sundreamer is a project which I’m allowing myself to take the ‘less is more’ approach more literally. I love exploring more complex arrangements, sound design and upbeat ideas with edapollo. With Sundreamer I want to keep things more stripped back, ambient and minimal. I guess listeners will hear edapollo in Sundreamer and vice versa but for me this new project just felt right for some of the creations I’ve been making.

                Judging by Spotify, you released 3 solo singles and 3 collaborative singles in 2020. What has collaboration brought to you and your music in 2020?

                Collaboration was fun during lockdown, it allowed me to feel connected to other artists. It also allowed me to push my sonic boundaries a little bit further and explore new ideas.

                How did you find Memoir Records and why did you decide to release your upcoming 5 track EP with them?

                A friend of mine had released with Memoir and I really loved the labels aesthetic and could see the tracks I’d been making fit well on the label!

                Is Sundreamer sonically inspired by any other artists? If so, any albums/tracks in particular?

                I would say Bibio is a big influence on the sound, I love the warped guitars and delicate field recordings he uses, which are techniques I’ve explored in Sundreamer.
                There’s a piano piece on the EP which is inspired by artists like Nils Frahm and Olafur Arnalds. Other influences include my love for guitar music, you’ll probably hear hints of post-rock artists like explosions in the sky and perhaps a touch bit of Khruangbin.

                What music have you been listening to over the course of 2020? Anything to specifically relax or modify your mood? Anything you've continuously come back to?

                Khruangbin, Teebs, Teen Daze, Washed out and loads more!
