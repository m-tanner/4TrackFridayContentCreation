                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                Props to Kyle for last week! I was a little jealous he landed on the magic number, but he earned it no doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
                This week I am excited to share three tiny Australian acts with you, plus a resurfaced (to me) legend.
            </p>

                Phosphorescent pop | DEADALIVE | Jaguar Jonze
            </h2>
            <p>
                Jaguar Jonze is Deena Lynch, an Australian singer/songwriter born in Japan to
                a Taiwanese mother and Australian father. She writes in her bio that
                this cultural eclectic-ness has resulted in an artist of diverse influences,
                ranging from Portishead to Nick Cave.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm calling this one "phosphorescent pop" because the track has this dark,
                sometimes electronically gritty and over-driven vibe to it, but somehow shines
                through to me as a pop track. It feels like it "glows in the dark."

                Post-punk revival | Thank You for the Honey, Honey | Teenage Dads
            </h2>
            <p>
                The first of two acts this week that stand out for their project names,
                the Teenage Dads crack me up. Jordan, Connor, Angus, and Vincent are
                four high school friends from Australia's Mornington Peninsula and
                are trying to inject their fresh sound into the worldwide scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                After binging on Interpol (<i>Turn on the Bright Lights</i> and
                <i>Antics</i> specifically) recently, I was very happy to stumble upon
                these guys, which definitely have a sound can be mentioned in the same
                sentence as those greats. What I find even more exciting is that they
                self record, produce, and mix all of their own music! They even do their
                own music videos and tour management. They claim that this distills into a
                delightful live vibe.
            </p>
            <p>
                This track features an amazing voice and a hook that makes me smile every
                single time. Supported by bopping drums and energetic guitars, it
                keeps me thumping my foot throughout. I can't wait to get to one of their
                live shows.

                Electronica | When I Go | Emancipator
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have felt a deep need lately for music that sounds like a blanket feels.
                Maybe you know what I mean. Something that's warm and calming, but sonically.
            </p>
            <p>
                Naturally, I was drawn to listen to old Emancipator, the solo project of
                Oregon-native Douglas Appling. His debut album, <i>Soon It Will Be Cold Enough,</i>
                established him as a mainstay of electronica and his follow up albums only
                raised expectations. When I saw him perform his fifth studio album live (thus becoming livetronica),
                he played alongside four or so other artists on live instruments and it was an
                absolute delight. I find that the vibe translates really well into home/headphone
                listening.
            </p>
            <p>
                With such a large discography to choose from, I landed on this track for
                how light-footed it is. I'm not sure if the vocalist recorded this for
                this particular track or if it's a sample from something else, but she
                just <i>has so much fun.</i> I can't help but smile as she seems to
                mess around on the track. If you like it, you'll be happy to know there's
                much more out there for you dig into.

                Future rap | Land | Hazy, Narli, JK-47
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the rappers is named JK-47 - how could I NOT share that?
            </p>
            <p>
                It's icing on the cake at this point, but the track is also well produced
                in a future house style with very satisfying bars laid within.
                Narli and JK-47 are underground, indigenous Australian hip-hop artists who
                deliver bars that make it obvious that they're going somewhere. You're in on
                'em early.
