                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                So having to write for this week’s songs made me think of a project I had to do in my high school English class where we had to pick a song and rhetorically analyze it. Luckily for those of you who read this, I will not be doing that here.

                Folk-y indie rock - Two Hands by Big Thief
            </h2>
            <p>
                To start off the songs for this week, I knew I wanted to choose something from Big Thief but it was so hard to figure out which one. I mean they came out with <b>TWO</b> albums this year and I thought both were fantastic. Adrianne Lenker, the lead singer, has such a unique voice and it just draws me in.  It helps that their music does a great job of highlighting it and I’m a sucker for music like that.

                French electronica with a hint of techno - Diamond Veins by French 79 feat. Sarah Rebecca
            </h2>
            <p>
                A few months ago my friend Jack told me he almost bought a ticket to Paris to see French 79 and immediately after hanging out with him I had to check 'em out. He did not disappoint because I could not stop listening (and would totally fly to France to see him). Simon Henner, the man behind French 79, makes electronic music that makes me think of being in an 80s video game mixed with stranger things. His music has a way of creating a scene in my head with just sounds. Most of his music is just instrumental but I chose Diamond Veins because I really like the addition of Sarah’s voice.

                Indie pop - Ancient Mars by The Zolas
            </h2>
            <p>
                I absolutely love The Zolas! They’re a Vancouver based band that has a classic indie pop vibe. Their most recent album is from 2016 but supposedly they’re working on something new *shrugs*?  I first listened to them 4 years ago when I moved to Seattle and they very quickly became a top band for me. One of their songs even inspired a tattoo I have (song: Molotov girls). I’ve seen them twice and it’s always been at small intimate venues which is nice because they stick around after the shows and hangout with fans which is fun.

                Ethereal electro pop - Twisted by Fractures
            </h2>
            <p>
                This song by Fractures is the one I know best. I originally found him (him being Mark Zito) 6 years ago and haven’t really listened to him since that summer but my discover weekly from a few weeks ago had a song where the opening sounded similar to this one. This song is <b>WAY</b> better than the one on my discover weekly and led me to re-discover Fractures. Mark’s songs are so emotional and dark but not in the way that makes me depressed and teary eyed. They have a lighter up-beat sound to them and his voice is so calming. Oh and I forgot to mention he’s Australian (that’s mostly for Tanner).

                If there’s one thing I learned in high school English, it was to close by tying in the beginning. So on that note I hope this read better than my rhetorical analysis of “Until the Day I Die” by Story of the Year, yes I know sooooo emo.
