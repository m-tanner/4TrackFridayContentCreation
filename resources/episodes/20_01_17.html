                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                This morning we're treated to an interview with Ed Bidgood, the artist behind the project
                <a href="https://edapollo.bandcamp.com/"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">edapollo</a> and whose
                track "Velvia" was part of Four Track Friday's very first episode on July 5th, 2019.
                Ed describes himself as a multidisciplinary creative, specializing in graphic design, photography, and
                music.
                You can see his designs on
                <a href="https://www.edbidgood.com/work#e-2" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Bonobo's

                other artist's EP's (like Frameworks' recent <a href="https://www.edbidgood.com/work#e-7"
                                                                style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;"><i>Imagine

                 width="400">
            <p>
                Ed grew up in the UK, but recently moved to from Bristol to Melbourne.
                Always wanting to live overseas, ending a long relationship and a long-term job, and knowing
                his sister already lived in Melbourne came together to cultivate the big move, which Ed explained
                significantly influenced his creative process. He had to sell much of his larger, expensive gear
                before moving. However, Ed says that sometimes being limited in hardware allows him to be more creative,
                worrying less about what to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                In that vein, Ed had some advice for anyone looking to get into music production, saying,
                "I think starting out with a few simple bits of gear and understanding the
                basics of production is the first step and then finding your sound through
                experimenting with other instruments and methods."
                He went on to say he's recently been buying back more gear, but that he focuses on
                it as a source of refreshment and inspiration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of getting into production, Ed has been making music since he was thirteen.
                He learned to play guitar and then spent most of his teens touring in a band
                and writing music. However, he only began seriously producing music around 2013.
                When asked what advice he would give to his younger self, Ed summed it up by
                saying "less is more." He elaborated,
                "Recently I’ve been really thinking about what elements of tracks are needed
                and what is not and can be removed...
                I think when I was younger I had a tendency to try to do too much
                and layer / over complicate things."
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, Ed has never explicitly learned music theory. When asked how he knows
                what notes to play, he said,
                "I’m actually a bit different than most musicians, as I don’t really know much theory! I
                taught myself guitar when I was younger and I would just make up chords and
                progressions with no clue what I was playing, just using my ears to guide me. I still
                do this to be honest and it seems to work. Sometimes I can hear the next chord or
                note sequence in my head before I’ve played it and then I take time to work it out."
            </p>
            <p>
                It definitely does seem to work! Ed just released his first full-length album last year after
                having released four EP's, which began with his first in 2014. Each offers a different,
                luscious journey. Ed seems most happy with this most recent album, saying it's his most cohesive project
                to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something that continues to make its way into and inspire Ed's work is nature, particularly water.
                He collected and used many field recordings of waterfalls, crashing waves, and rain in the album.
                A returning metaphor for him is how creativity can flow from the mind like water if allowed,
                which is a concept so central that it's featured front and center on the album art for <i>Endless
                Cascades</i> (shown below).
            </p>

                 width="400">
            <p>
                Of course, Ed and I also discussed the artists that have
                influenced his sound, which musicians he's (re)discovered lately, and (my favorite)
                who he would listen to if he could only listen to two artists for the rest of his life.
                Ed responded to the first bit, saying,
                "Bonobo, Tycho, Maribou State and various others influenced me to get
                better at producing music. They are all masters of their craft and are very inspiring."
            </p>
            <p>
                I used these answers to build this week's curation. Let's get into some tracks.

                Ketto by Bonobo
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bonobo is one of Ed's musical heroes and biggest influences, which seems to be
                somewhat common among emerging electronica artists. Teisha Matthews
                (the person behind TSHA, whose track "Moon" went out on 4TF's October 4th, 2019 episode)
                said the same thing in her
                <a href="https://edm.com/interviews/tsha-beats-1-one-mix"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">interview with Beats 1</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I called up Joe to ask him how to best represent Bonobo in a single song and, after expressing great
                displeasure in trying to do something so unfair, he settled on Ketto or Kiara. From there,
                I selected the track from Bonobo's 2006 release.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project of British musician Simon Green, Bonobo debuted in 1999.
                Over the years, Green's sound has shifted from
                predominantly sample-based production to more live instrumentation.
                All the while, Green's mastering and ability to create multi-layered atmospheres flourished.
                A great example of this is the 2017 track, "Break Apart," which you
                can hear more about in its <a href="https://songexploder.net/bonobo"
                                              style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">exploded version</a>.

                Natural Fools by Maribou State
            </h2>
            <p>
                Ed also cited Maribou State, the electronic duo consisting of Chris Davids and Liam Ivory,
                as an inspiration. After listening to the album <i>Portraits</i> several times, I could hear why.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two produced the whole album in a shed behind Ivory's parents' house using a
                highly collaborative process. One of them would bring a loop of guitar or drums, which
                would launch the two into a process that rarely resulted in anything remotely
                similar to that with which they started.
            </p>
            <p>
                To hear more about the duo, their process, and their inspirations, I recommend

                Unravel by Björk
            </h2>
            <p>
                When asked to limit the remainder of his life's musical variety to two artists,
                Ed first picked Björk. He also mentioned that she would be his dream collaborator because of her
                creative diversity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ed pointed me to this song, which originally hooked him into
                the Icelandic singer. The track has tons of space in it and is delicately atmospheric, with only Björk's
                voice cutting through. It comes from her 1997 album, <i>Homogeneic</i>, which is the first album
                I've ever noticed to receive a
                <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22835-homogenic/"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">perfect ten from Pitchfork</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Björk began writing music at age eleven before releasing a collection of covers
                alongside a few original songs a year later, including an instrumental. Diving into her
                process reveals a creative mastermind, capable of envisioning massive soundscapes
                and weaving melodies. This is exemplified in her original and stripped-back-strings-only
                versions of "Stonemilker," which you can hear more about
                <a href="https://songexploder.net/bjork" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">in this
                    podcast</a>.

                A Walk by Tycho
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sharing one of my own selections, Ed said Tycho was his second "for life" choice, saying,
                "his releases are always consistently good and I love his sound." Ed also cited
                Tycho's production quality as an inspiration. (Hilariously, however, Scott Hansen has publicly discussed
                <a href="https://songexploder.net/tycho" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">past
                    production errors</a>.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Tycho is truly capable of taking the listener on a journey, often depicting rises and falls
                like the sunrise and sunset in their music. Ed shares this ability, recently displaying it on <i>Endless
                Cascades</i>
                and in his very enjoyable recent
                <a href="https://youtu.be/nXppKrHSd5w" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">30-minute mix
                    for Stereofox</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the best tracks to witness this ability from Tycho is definitely
                <a href="https://youtu.be/8KGBHWeywjw" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">A Walk</a>.
                Scott's synth and guitar, Zac's bass, Rory's drums, and, these days, Billy's background keys
                easily lead the listener on journey from quiet contemplation to dancy cheer.

                Black Dove by Teebs feat. Sudan Archives
            </h2>
            <p>
                Finally, I had to ask Ed what music he's discovered recently and he pointed me
                to Teebs' newest album, the 2019 <i>Anicca</i>, saying, "I think it's his first album
                in six years, so I'd forgotten how good he is. I've been listening a lot to him!"
                The new album features several collaborations and Mtendere Mandowa (Teebs) and
                Brittney Parks (Sudan Archives) come together on this track to deliver
                and eerie mellowness with easy confidence. The album is a fifteen track giant,
                so be sure to check out the rest!
