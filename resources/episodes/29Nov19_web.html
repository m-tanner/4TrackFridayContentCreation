                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                Welcome to week 22 of Four Track Friday. I'm happy to be back for my third week of hosting! I discovered
                some songs with awesome vocals I thought were worth sharing so I asked Michael if I could host this week
                and luckily our Supreme Leader of Music said yes! So let's get into the music!

                Classical Infused Pop - Empty Crown by YAS
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yasmeen Al-Mazeedi (YAS) is an incredibly talented violinist and vocalist and she showcases both of her
                skills in "Empty Crown." She blends pop with classical violin to near perfection and I haven't been able
                to get enough of this song. The one thing I know after listening is I need to listen to more of her
                music and I can't wait for her future releases.
            </p>

                In Your Feels - Can't Let Go by Valntn (feat. Emilia Ali)
            </h2>
            <p>
                I can't get enough of Emilia Ali in this song. Her voice is mesmerizing throughout, especially as it
                fades out right before the drop. The first time I gave this song a real listen was on my recent flight
                from Saint Louis back to D.C. and I'm pretty sure I played it about 10 times on the flight.

                Emotionally Charged Electronic - nothing will last by nøll and damboy!
            </h2>
            <p>
                I hadn't listened to any noll before I heard this song but that quickly changed. His music is so
                appealing because it's so raw and relatable. In "nothing will last" he tells the story of creeping
                self-doubt following the unraveling of a previously strong relationship. Paring an immersive track with
                introspective lyrics makes for a highly enjoyable listening experience.

                Melodic, Bass-Featured Enigma - Heart Made of Stone by The Tech Theives
            </h2>
            <p>
                So as you can guess by the previous line, I'm having a really hard time putting my finger on how to
                describe this song. I know I really really like it but words are escaping me but that is the beauty of
                music. It makes us feel ways we can't describe.
            </p>
            <p>
                As soon as I heard this song, I knew it needed to be featured in a Four Track. The combination of
                melody, the bass, the groove is just right and I hope you all agree.
