                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                As the seasons change, I find myself drawn to classics and old favorites. This makes discovering new
                music quite the challenge, but I was able to dig up these to share with you. For this reason, I'm
                incredibly excited for the upcoming guest hosts to inject some freshness into my life! The first one
                is up next week and I hope to find out how many back-to-back guests we can have. For now,
                let's dive into this week's four!
            </p>

                Digital experiment | Inharmonious Slog | Photay
            </h2>
            <p>
                A long time ago, the Tanner brothers found themselves drinking Stoli on the rocks
                and waiting for RJD2 to take the stage. However, when Evan Shornstein took the stage it was clear there
                wouldn't be a rush to get right to the headliner.
            </p>

                This Aphex Twin-influenced artist had just returned from a trip to Guinea, West Africa and he brought
                the polyrhythmic beats back with him. Borrowing Photay's own description of his music,
                "It is not designed exclusively for headphones nor the dance floor, but is genuinely at home in both contexts."
                We happened to be on the dance floor and defintely found the tunes well suited for the situation.

                I've relished recently returning to his unique sound. This track is one of his most palatable
                and is one I think you'll really enjoy it.

                For something a bit more guitar-forward, we have something from this four-piece group from New South Wales,
                Australia. They hit the scene hard in 2017 and haven't slowed down since.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is their first single from their upcoming album and I can't imagine a track that would make me
                more excited to hear the full thing. The way they structure their songs is catchy. Their lyrics
                are memorable and sometimes even outright funny. Most striking though is their undeniable edginess.
                You can't listen without imbibing a certain amount of energy and I look forward to the full dose soon.

                Elliot showed me this peaceful track, which comes from the 2015 EP, <i>All My Friends Are Freaks.</i>
                Its beat comes
                across electronic with a fun mix of samples and synths while its lyrics deliver tender reminders of
                life's passing nature. I don't want to say a lot about this one; simply be sure to give it a dedicated listen and
                see where it takes you.

                In a rock dominated listening sesh last night, M. Vincent showed me this track and I was absolutely floored.
                The way Kala Rose's voice cuts through heavy guitars and drumming is simultaneously shocking and satisfying.

                This group came together in a basement after these O'Keefe Music Foundation students happened to meet
                one another. They started by playing cover songs, but quickly realized that they wanted to make a
                name for themselves. To do so, they say they mix together "bluesy riffs, thunderous bass and drums, and penetrating vocals."
                Give this one all the volume you can!
