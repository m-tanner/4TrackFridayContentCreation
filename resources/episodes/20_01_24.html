                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                No intro! Straight to some music! This week is heavy on hip-hop and soul and I hope you enjoy
                it as much as I do.

                Jazz-hop - Better Recognize by Apollo Bebop
            </h2>

            <p>
                Two years ago, several of us (you know who you are ;) went to a Sofar Show in Green Lake
                with all of the ingredients for margaritas in a paper bag.
                After enjoying <a href="https://ellaharp.com/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">EllaHarp</a>
                and an indie duo, Apollo Bebop took the stage.
                The living room of the quaint home quickly became filled with nodding heads.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Santa Ana-based quintet plays a potent combination of hip-hop and jazz, which shines on this
                release from October of last year. Citing influences like Chance the Rapper and Miles Davis, these five
                bring clever lyrics, driving bass, sexy saxophone, keys or guitar, and intricate drums to every track.
            </p>
            <p>
                They've experimented with everything from angsty with their

            <p>
                This one is somewhere in the middle and, if you like it, you'll be happy to know
                there's plenty more where this came from.

                Before spending most of high school skipping class to write songs,
                Paris Alexa Williams can first remember singing in public at the age of
                three. It's actually song-writing on which she first focused. However, when she completed
                writing her Post-Malone-intended single, <i>Ballin</i>
                her producer recommended that she perform it herself. Needless to say, it was
                a hit and her 2018 EP, <i>Flexa</i>, was quick to follow. It wasn't long before she was
                playing small shows and festivals, including the Capitol Hill Block Party in her hometown, Seattle.
            </p>
            <p>
                These days she's working on a new album, releasing her most recent single just four days ago.
                At the moment she's also touring with Xavier Omär, playing at the Showbox in downtown Seattle
                <a href="https://www.showboxpresents.com/events/detail/383770"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">TOMORROW</a>,
                before working her way down the rest of the west coast over the next several weeks. Hit me up if you
                want
                a buddy for the Seattle show!

                Hip-hop - Jump! (Live) by Quincy Morales
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/wKHHfzJRJjU"
               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live at Sofar Sounds</a>

               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Live at CBC</a>
            <p>
                You may notice this track's focus on staying strong mentally
                and pushing through to make those who believe in you proud and
                that's because Quincy Morales wrote this song at
                the lowest time in his life, according to
                <a href="https://yeahflix.com/quincymoralesjump/" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">this
                    2019 interview</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When combined with
                his ability to rhythmically dominate with his voice and perform well with
                a big, live band, this creates the energetic frenzy of <i>Jump!</i>, which released last year.
                Hopefully he puts out some more music soon.

            <p>
                Rebecca Hatch is quickly establishing herself as one of Australia's most soulful voices.
                After winning Triple J's
                <a href="https://www.triplejunearthed.com/competition/unearthed-high-indigenous-initiative-2017"
                   style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Unearthed High Indigenous Initiative</a>
                in 2017, the Australian-Samoan from Western Sydney
                has uploaded three tracks. Her first two are lofty and smooth R&B tracks, while this one leans into a
                bit of hip-hop.
                Listening to the interview linked above, it's obvious that Hatch brings a lot of of
                authenticity, playfulness, and passion to her music and I think we all have a lot to look forward to.
