                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re here for week seven. This was the most difficult week yet! New music was recently released from
                lots of my favorite acts, like PVRIS, edapollo, Guster, El Ten Eleven, Phantogram, and many more. On top
                of that, you sent me some great stuff!
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of you guys sending great stuff, I’m going to try the idea of a guest host once per month. Last
                month Joe shared some fantastic tracks and this month we’ll see what Scott has in store for us.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that, let’s get into the music.

                Dream folk — Suncats by Hazlett
            </h2>
            <p>
                I never knew Hazlett until I found this yesterday, but it stuck to me like only the rare ones can. All I
                can gather from the internet is that he’s an Australian making music in Sweden, but even that might not
                be right.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this track, the lyrical theme of leaving home while clinging to memories combines perfectly with the
                weightless vocals, acoustic guitar, and wavering keyboard in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope you enjoy the poem that is this song as much as I did.

                Indie rock — Tell Me More of Your Lies by Moon Loves Honey
            </h2>
            <p>
                After finding last week’s EGOISM, I went on a deep dive through shoegaze on Spotify. Moon Loves Honey, a
                group from Denmark, turned out to be my most delightful discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                There’s a great rock vibe to this one, which comes from their 2016 album, Apart. I must have listened to
                this whole album more than five times this week.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, if you like this one, but wonder what this group would sound like if it were a little more laid
                back and electronic, try out their 2018 album, You Drift Away From Me.
            </p>

                Small symphony — Olympians - Acoustic by Andrew Bird
            </h2>
            <p>
                I first found this artist when I volunteered at a film festival in high school, where “Fever Year” was
                screened. The film was half documentary and half concert-film, but wholly fantastic. As the title
                suggests, on a long year of touring, Andrew Bird actually had a low grade fever the whole time.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a fascinating tale, but what caught my eye the most was how he records his music and plays live.
                Bird plays several instruments on each track, employing electronic looping equipment to build the sounds
                into a song. This performance style has become a little more popular recently, with a now-famous Ted
                Talk and newer acts like Tash Sultana.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bird hasn’t stopped making music since the film, however, and this his newest release, which is a month
                old. I think those of you that like folk music will feel at home here. Let me know what you think.

                Progressive house — You See by Ryan Dominic
            </h2>
            <p>
                When Scott sent me this song last week, I thought to myself, “Wow, I haven’t really shared any house
                music.” For those of you that know my taste in music, house music was one of my longest phases. I still
                listen to it occasionally, but it really was all I listened to for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                In light of that, this community track is from an up-and-coming electronic producer, who just moved to
                LA from New York. Other than a slightly anchoring vocal riff, its lyric-less but with tons of
                synthesized melody. I know this track will be one that demands just a bit more volume every time it
                comes on in the car. If I’m lucky, it’ll even be nice enough to do so with the windows down.
