                Hi Everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
                Joseph here! It's great to be hosting the first 4TF of the new decade! To make it even better, I think
                this is my best week of music yet. I found some small artists with big time talent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also of note, Michael is currently on his second silent meditation retreat. We went on one together in
                Boston back in July. It's safe to say we both had incredible experiences as he is already on his second
                and I'm scheduled to go on my second this April. I know I speak for both of us when I say that if you
                meditate, take the leap and go on a week long retreat. You won't regret it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Related to this, there is going to be a slight delay in updating the playlists on Spotify and Apple
                Music. Before he left for retreat, Michael gave me access to all the code to write and send the email
                but we forgot to give me access to the playlists. I'll be sure to tell him to update them as soon as he
                returns from seeking enlightenment!
            </p>
            <p>
                Back to the music! Like I said, I tried to find small artists. The smallest this week is my favorite,
                Kim Ven, coming in at just 2k monthly listeners. After you hear her song, you'll probably be as
                surprised as I was. I'm going to keep the song descriptions short this week and let the music do the
                talking.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that, let's get into the first music of 2020!
            </p>

                Falsetto Forward Jazzy Pop - Nicotine by Ashley Alexander
            </h2>
            <p>
                First up we have this gem. Ashley's range in this song is incredibly impressive. This is one of his two
                songs he currently has on Spotify. His first being "Best Song." Ashley's vocals and beats are very
                groovy and you'll find yourself struggling to refrain from dancing in your seat.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shockingly, Ashley only comes in at 5k monthly listeners. "Nicotine" is experiencing some success with
                over 600k listens to this point. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't mind if he got some more love
                and exposure so we could hear even more of his vocals.
            </p>

                Playfully Progressive Beats - Lotus by Galdive | Osvaldorio | Wiana

               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Interview with Filter</a>
            <p>
                I love this collaboration. It features fractured female vocals just tantalizingly short of full strength
                that leave me wanting so much more. But in a good way. A very, very good way. In a way that makes me
                leave this song on repeat, vibing the entire time.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite component of this song is the playful piano slightly off-beat featured throughout. It adds a
                sense of levity that leads straight into the beautiful final 45 seconds of the song. If I only heard the
                last 45 seconds, I would think that I was watching a Studio Ghibli movie (if you don't understand this
                reference please educate yourself. P.S. start with Spirited Away).

                Melancholic Melody - Too Good by Kedam
            </h2>
            <p>
                This one is a little more low key than the others for the week. In fact, this is one of Kedam's slowest
                songs coming in at just over 100 bpm. The slower bpm is accompanied by down beat, reflective lyrics. The
                guitar serves as a fantastic compliment to the seductively splendid bass line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hopefully, this song doesn't bring a specific person to mind for you. But, then again, if you've been
                looking for a way to get out of that relationship, maybe just text your s/o a link to this song. Who
                knew Kedam could not only give you chill vibes but also help you with a breakup.

                Enchanting Electronica - Sunrise by Lamalo | Kim Ven
            </h2>

               style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Song Exploded</a>
            <p>
                Last but certainly not least, we have my favorite for the week. Kim's voice comes through the speaker
                smooth yet effortless. Surprisingly enough, Kim and Lamalo produced this in Lamalo guitarist Yossi
                Casscun's home kitchen studio. Along with the release of the EP comes their first ever music video for
                Sunrise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of all the four songs of the week, this is the one I had on repeat for the longest. It reminds me of the
                days when I saw the sun for more than 6 hours every day (I don't know how you Seattle folks do it). So
                sit back, get yourself a Corona, and let Kim transport you to a warmer, happier climate.
