                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                We're in the final month of the year and you know what that means... Spotify's 2020 Wrapped is live!
                I learned that my top artist is still Tycho, my top song was Lane 8's road, and that I listened
                to 86,691 minutes of Spotify. I'd love to hear what your results are! Share them with me
                <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/K6JBSFT" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">in this quick survey</a>
                and I'll put together a week or two using what I discover!
            </p>
            <p>
                After Denzel Curry went out last week,
                Joe shared some more content with me and I want to pass it along.
            </p>
            <p>
                Triple J's "Like a Version" series has Curry

                "Bulls On Parade." One of the comments reads, "He sounds angrier than Zack.
                Never thought that was possible." I have to agree and will go even further to say that this version to be overall better than the original.
                Curry also went on Kenny Beats' YouTube channel for a
                <a href="https://youtu.be/GWenb9Noq_A" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block" target="_blank">freestyle sesh</a>
                that absolutely slaps and is hilarious, to boot.
                This takes me back to the boom bap sound that I love so much and sent me on an

                Lush RnB | Say Something | MAXINE
            </h2>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/Fr5h0HX2Bfg" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline;">Official Music Video</a>
            <p>
                Citing Lauryn Hill as one of her influences, you know MAXINE going to be good. Maxine Champion is a fresh
                artist out of Sydney and this is her fourth track. There's not a a lot out there about her,
                but this track was enough to catch my ear. The mix is luxurious with drums way in the back,
                bass front and low, and centered, soulful vocals stealing the show.
                This one really slows my day down.

                Reggae | Your Way | Stick Figure
            </h2>
            <p>
                I hadn't listened to reggae in a while, the usual season having left us behind like the sunshine.
                But when Anna sent me Stick Figure I spent the next two days listening to all my favorites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scott Woodruff is the man behind the act, doing vocals, guitar, and production. He's released seven
                full-length albums and this is from his fourth. Much more downbeat than some other well known reggae names,
                Woodruff's take on the genre is quite rhythmic and only sometimes features recessed vocals.
            </p>
            <p>
                I picked this track because it has my favorite bass line on the album, which, combined with its rhythmic
                keys and dance-y vocals, gets my head bobbing no doubt. Make things go your way with this one.

                Lyrical Post-Rock | Language | Stablemate
            </h2>
            <p>
                Eric sent me this one a couple weeks ago after Stablemate released their debut EP.
                "Language" is Eric's favorite track on the album while mine is "Squint," but the listener wins this time!
            </p>
            <p>
                Conor, Mitch, Anna, and Daniel recently united to become the Gig Harbor-based band you hear here.
                Conor and Mitch have been making music together for years, but took a hiatus while the former
                enlisted in the Navy and the latter embarked on a drive to Argentina. Now, they've picked up a second vocalist
                and a drummer and are committed to making music.
            </p>
            <p>
                This album ebs and flows from folksy to electronic, art rock, post-rock, and everything in between.
                "Language" in particular could absolutely be a post-rock track if it didn't have the vocals, but with the
                brooding lyrics hits a whole 'nother level.
                The male/female layering, precise drumming, and sweeping musicality coming from
                keys, guitar, and other elements deliver an unnerving four minutes of music. Packaged by a sparkling
                clean production that's incredibly well-staged, the whole album is a really enjoyable listen.

                Sunset Pop | i wanna kiss boys cos i'm bored | Lucy Sugerman
            </h2>
            <p>
                Bedroom pop, but when it makes you want to "get into a 1978 Ford Mustang and just keep driving towards the horizon,"
                like it does for Pip Rasmussen of triple j unearthed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Channeling bits and pieces of Lily Allen, La Roux, and others, Sugerman brings a vulnerable yet sassy
                vibe to her storytelling. This one's as catchy as it is glossy and it's going to be stuck in your head for sure.
