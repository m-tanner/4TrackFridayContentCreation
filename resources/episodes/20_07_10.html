                Hello!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you to those of you that checked out the new features and tracks from last week.
                As promised,
                <a href="https://4trackfriday.com/survey/year1" target="_blank" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block">I have a survey for you to take!</a>
                It's very helpful to know which tracks are your
                favorite so that I can search for more like them! I may also be able to figure out last year's most
                popular guest host and send them an prize... I'm thinking a <b>$10 music streaming service gift card,</b>
                but only if you vote!
            </p>
            <p>
                This week is dominated by new Australian releases, true to form for me.
                The first two are tastebreakers for me; let's get to 'em!

                Western folk | Two of a Kind by Adam Newling
            </h2>
            <p>
                Adam Newling's newest has less than 1,000 plays on Spotify, but I think you'll find it well worth
                a listen or two. He belts with a voice characterized by gravel, a bit of twang, and whole lot of power.
                The rest of the track is organized around this: the western guitar and railroad rhythm heighten
                the mood before stepping completely aside for vocal solos. Get drunk up off this one straight out of
                New South Whales.

                Slightly screaming | Sleep Sound by Closure
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I'm asked "what music do you like?" I usually respond with something along the lines of
                "everything except Country and Screamo."
                Well, this one comes right up against Screamo for me. Somehow, though, that makes
                it all the better.
            </p>
            <p>
                This four-piece from Sydney defines their genre as Emo/Pop Punk, which is spot on. Their use of
                heavy guitar, double bass pedal, and female vocals create a ton of energy that just gets your
                heart beating a bit faster. Give these guys three minutes and let them get you stoked.

                Smooth pop | Stuck in a Bubble by George Alice
            </h2>
            <p>
                George Alice is no stranger to the indie pop spotlight. Her track, "Circles," won the Unearthed High
                competition last year and has over three-million plays. That first release became well known
                for it's dark, mysterious atmosphere and incredibly strong vocals. This one is a strong follow up to that
                success, but comes with a much smoother groove.
            </p>
            <p>
                Still dark verses transition to soft pre-chorus before launching into a totally catchy hook. Toss in the
                well written lyrics and this one might just set you on fire.

                Rap | Mean Time by Dharmarat
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I was getting into KVKA a few weeks ago, I noticed a similar artist called Dharmarat. The name
                immediately struck me as odd for a rapper, "dharma" meaning "the teachings of the Buddha."
            </p>
            <p>
                A rapper making tracks in his bedroom, Adam Tukiri lives in Auckland and
                loves to dig around record stores for samples to rap over. I'm not sure what he dug up to end up with
                this one, but it's much easier to listen to than any of his other top tracks. I hope you dig its
                smooth sax and easy beat.
