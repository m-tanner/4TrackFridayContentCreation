                Hi friends,
            </p>
            <p>
                My sincere thanks go out to Joe for hosting last week. It's always a treat for me to be on the receiving end of an episode.
                Now I'm back to host the 44<sup>th</sup>, which edges us yet closer to Four Track's one-year-anniversary.
                If you're not already on
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/690075665099371/" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block">the guest list</a>
                for the party in its honor, do so! It'll be on July 11<sup>th</sup> - I hope you can make it!
            </p>
            <p>
                The new website features are <i>almost</i> here! They work on my laptop but aren't quite ready for prime time, but
                will be soon. Next week I intend for you to be able to make a profile for other listeners to see, like songs,
                and manage your email subscription. Think positive thoughts and send them my way to help me come through.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm excited about the tracks this week as I've enjoyed having them on repeat for a few days.
                They are a nice mix of fresh faces alongside some more well-established acts that will leave you with the
                ability to dig into deep and delectable discographies if you so choose. Let's get to 'em.

                Alt | Is Everybody Going Crazy? by Nothing But Thieves
            </h2>
            <p>
                This smasher comes from the absolutely killer British five-piece that formed back in 2012.
                I was first introduced to the act by their affecting "Graveyard Whistling,"
                in which Conor Mason really shows off his upper register.
            </p>
            <p>
                This track, though, is hot off the press and all-too-timely. In it Conor sings,
                "Is anyone else feeling lonely? / It just can't be me only / Losing our cool so slowly." I mean, come on,
                is there anything more perfect for these times?
            </p>
            <p>
                They went so far as to make their
                <a href="https://youtu.be/sSD9ePFUkvM" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block">official music video</a>
                for this one quarantine-themed.
                They didn't stop there though, even performing it
                <a href="https://youtu.be/K5DkT_zrzaw" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block">live from solitude</a>
                for YouTube! I don't like being preached to about social distancing,
                but when it comes in a form this enjoyable, I'm all for it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, I've always known that if I ever sent out Nothing But Thieves I would be required to share
                <a href="https://youtu.be/WxDq6k5hNfE" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block">this cover they did.</a>
                If I had to narrow down the world's music to several favorites, this one would make my cut.
                The band's energy combined with Conor's incredibly powerful vocals
                is impossibly infectious. I'm only sad that I can't get this audio on Spotify. Please, check it out.

                Post hop | aux cord by Nardean
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I heard this song for the first time earlier this week, it shot to the top of my list. When was the last time
                you heard a female Australian emcee who was born to an Egyptian family spit fire about her struggle against expectations?
                And when was the last time you heard a rapper seamlessly switch between English and Arabic in the same verse? I'll boldly claim "never."
            </p>
            <p>
                Nardean got her start by writing poetry, which quickly transformed into producing hip hop. Then she
                began singing a bit more, resulting in hooks like you hear here.
                The result combines the influences of hip hop, neo-soul, electronica, glitch and R&B in what she's coined as
                "post hop."
            </p>
            <p>
                Anytime you find a voice that sounds as good as this discussing issues as real as this, you have no choice but to share and encourage it.

                Raop | On Read by Austin Millz & Pell
            </h2>
            <p>
                This track has a way of <i>demanding</i> more volume when it comes on and, I must say, I always oblige.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pell was sent in by Tenzin last week and I quickly discovered this newly released bop.
                It's got a bass-slappin' groove, smooth synths, and catchy chat.
                <a href="https://youtu.be/i0EtKEPE-uc" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block">The lyric video</a>
                is hilarious to boot, as it's all done as a text conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next time someone's tryna play games with you, just put this on and tell 'em, "no need to text back baby, just leave it on read."

                Parisian pop | Agitations Tropicales by L'Impératrice
            </h2>
            <p>
                I have a confession to make. I'm addicted to L'Impératrice. And it's DJ's fault. I believe Aaron sent
                this to DJ, but he shoulders the blame for exposing me to this now-insatiable urge I have for funky French tunes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded by Charles de Boisseguin in 2012, this group quickly expanded to six musicians. The founder grew up in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, very close to Versailles.
                He told
                <a href="https://mixmag.net/feature/get-to-know-limperatrice" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" style="color: #B200FD; text-decoration: underline; display: inline-block">mixmag,</a>
                “It’s the home of Daft Punk, Air, Phoenix and the French Touch sound." Talk about some tough acts to follow.
                However, he's created an act that can withstand the comparisons. Originally started as an instrumental group,
                Charles says L'Impératrice's sound really took off after they found Flore Benguigui, the
                sensually smooth voice you hear on this track.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm so jealous that this is considered "pop" in Paris. Catch me hosting the next episode from France, even if it's only in my imagination.
